As much as I can remember, I was in the woods or a sort of jungle. I was with a girl of whom is familiar, but I can't place her. We came upon this tribe of people. They were white, with features like a North American and spoke English. There were 2 men about to be executed in this dream. There were 2 executioners, 1 man and one woman. They were familiar, but I didn't know their names. The people being executed were not familiar at all. The method of execution was sort of gruesome. First they cut one arm off then a leg, then the other arm and leg. Then they cut the body in 2 pieces lengthways (no blood or screams). While this was being done, orders were given on how to do it. All I could hear was a voice, a female's, giving instructions. The girl and I left, we were free to go and were not captives. We began to walk down the road, and behind us were the 2 executioners carrying the remains of the 2 dead. The woods along the side of the road seemed to be full of people. In the woods we then saw the 2 men that were just executed. We then found out that the 2 men that were killed were just dummies, but they were very lifelike, but no one was killed. To the girl and I, this was not a funny joke. So as we continued, we came to a bus station. This was odd because we were in the woods. So we prepared to give the bus driver money for the tickets and the dream ended.","character":"1FKA, 2MEA, 2MOA, 1FSA, 1MOA, 1MOA","emotion":null,"text_len":1435,"word_count":291},{"id":"norms-m","name":"Hall\/VdC Norms: Male","number":"0225","time":"1940s-1950s","date":null,"gender":"M","age":"Y","text":"I was in a small classroom with some students from my chemistry section; however the class seemed to be in French.

I went to the freezer and decided that I should eat something that I have had in there for some time. In the process I found things I didn't realize were in there or things that I had forgotten were in there. I took a round, forest green tablecloth folded in half out to the front porch, deciding that I would eat out there for a change. It was a classic picnic table like you would see in a park. There was already a cranberry colored tablecloth on the table so I placed the green one, still folded, over part of one lengthwise side of the table so you could see both. I think I placed something else on the table too but I can't remember what it was. I went back inside and started rearranging the things in the refrigerator. Now I was working in a dorm-side refrigerator, finding all kinds of things. I thought, I keep forgetting this one is even here. I found things that we had put in that freezer, leftovers from my son's high school graduation party in June. There were two packages of hot dogs; each one had been opened so I combined them. There were ziplock bags of sliced cheese and crackers that I decided to put in the other refrigerator so I would remember to use them for my bedtime snack. There was a package of sausage. As I was moving things I found some very old lettuce in the back. I took it out and laid it aside to throw away. I also found an individual serving bottle of juice with no lid on it. There were a couple of things that were just a bite or two and I took them out thinking that I would just consume them now rather than keeping them and I wouldn't dare just throw them out. I took the juice bottle out to drink right away as well. As I was picking up the lettuce off the floor I put it in the sink to put in the garbage disposal. Now it was much more than when I took it out and there were other things as well. It filled one side of the sink. While I was doing this, there were three men sitting at my kitchen table. One of them was interviewing the other two about 911. They kept glancing at me and what I was doing. For some reason I also had tools and parts lying on the floor around me as though I was fixing the refrigerator as well. I realized I would have to move some of these things when they were ready to leave or they would not be able to get out. I did this as I saw them wrapping up and they got up to leave. The interviewer left and the other two stood there and talked with each other.

I'm sleeping days now, since my sleep cycle's reversed. I'll dictate the latter one first, since I woke up and made a few notes to remind me of the first one. In this dream my wife and I are in my mother's home. She's out in the living room with my mother and a couple of other people, who turned out to be Florence and Chris. I'm in the bedroom, still in bed, and our daughter is in there with me. And another figure's in a bed on the other side of the room. Eventually this figure says, \"Wouldn't you like to play with some blocks?\" and I realize it's my Aunt Flossie. And I say that our daughter would like to play with them. The blocks seem to be the blocks from the Binet kit. I don't realize this at the time, but my Aunt Flossie died some two or three years ago. well, I eventually go out into the living room, and with my mother. And I don't remember whether my wife's around now or not, but Florence and Chris and Aunt Flossie. And Aunt Flossie's out in the kitchen making some coffee, and I'm out there with her, when suddenly I realize that she's dead. And I look at her and tell her, \"You're dead; you're not here!\" And she doesn't have much of a reply. And I figure if she's dead, there's something very unreal about the whole thing. So I said, \"If you're dead, none of this is real.\" So I reach out and touch the coffee pot, which is boiling, and it doesn't feel hot, as I suspected it would. And I pass my hands thru the gas flames on the stove, and they're only very slightly warm. And I'm sort of satisfied at having proved my point. And I wander thru some other rooms, and I'm starting to go into the living room, and Florence and Chris and Aunt Flossie are starting to follow me. And they're starting to annoy me, because I said if this isn't real, I'll start manipulating it to be somewhat better now. So I step into the living room and make a heavy wooden door appear behind me and slam shut in their faces. And I make another one appear at the other door of the living room and slam that shut. The living room doesn't look really like the one in my mother's house. And then I look out the glass window and fly out right thru it, and fly away high up into the sky. And I sail around for a while, and then want to fly thru the night sky, like I did in the previous dream I'll describe later. So I close my eyes and wish myself to be on the other side of the world, where it's night with the moon out, flying in the sky. But I open them again and nothing's changed, except it seems to be a little bit later. So I continue sailing up in the sky here, about 50 feet or so from the ground. Then I fly over some trees which are around this very big house. The house is about -- it's brick, 3 stories tall. But then, above the 3 stories, it now has 2 more stories of wood which form sort of a very deluxe penthouse, with trees placed all around it, screening it from view from the ground. And down below on the ground, there are all sorts of holly wreaths and Christmas decorations up around the house. So I fly in and out among the trees and in toward this house, and several times I almost bump into the walls, but I stop myself in mid-air and turn around. Incidentally, I don't have to flap my, I don't have to fly by flapping my arms as I did in the previous dream. And eventually in my flying around, I notice a woman standing on one of the porches. And I fly around some more and eventually get into the house. And I've already worked out in my mind a sort of fantasy about this woman. She lives alone, with just one servant, because her husband died a long time ago. And I fly inside the house and meet her, and start talking to her. And she's been in seclusion for five years since her husband's death. And she looks sort of like a combination of a child that's multiplied in size and an old woman.

I said 'let me see' but when I looked at them he said he had rearranged the list a bit, but had actually made his own list of 21. He said \"you like cool movies\". He asked us what we thought of Sean Connery and I said I didn't really care. He said that James Bond films needed to be studied. I asked if they had any Alain Delon movies there and he didn't know who it was. Then he said \"have you seen Le Samourai?\" and I was like 'how can you have seen that and not know who Alain Delon is?'. Carl Weathers was then with us. I said that I felt like rewatching Arrested Development and he started singing 'it ain't easy being white'. And I said '... black'. Everyone else asked what we were talking about. Then this weird stuff happened. There was a reddish liquid on the floor. It Cortexaphan and I said 'oh no they di'nt'. There was another liquid that glowed green. It turned out the guy behind the counter was dodgy. There was a lab out the back. I said that I knew something was up because he didn't know who Alain Delon was. Then he was Alain Delon and I was watching him in his lab and he was watching me and had a knife. I said 'I'm just watching'. Then we were outside and he used the liquid and sprayed it with water and he explained (in a French accent) that it kept the wall in a different 'plane of existence' so that the water wouldn't stay. I asked 'so if it was used on a human, they wouldn't age and their eyes wouldn't fail' and he said yes. Then he was actually a 'good' bad guy. There was another bad guy doing other stuff. Alain Delon stood on a little step and yelled at the guy and I was thinking he looked really hot. I started checking him out and was staring at his butt and was thinking that wasn't like me. Then he said that \"it's now\" and the liquid was going to explode. We lay down, as did the bad guy. Then he told me to run for it. As we did, it exploded and there was red smoke.

Someone mistakes me for a Master's student and says, \"Come on, you're next.\" On a whim, I decide to try it. I wear green and yellow sweats (UO colors) and brush my hair up into a weird male pompadour hairdo. I go in, and up on stage. I bang away on chairs, drums, walls, anything around and the rhythm is quite good. I hope they don't ask me any theory questions; I wouldn't know them. I think about what a 16th note would be like. The audience loves me. They think I'm a guy and they cheer wildly for me. They are far back in the auditorium. I walk down a side ramp or stairs toward the front of the stage. I see the head of a professor, but not his body. I guess the body is behind a wooden door, partition, at the front of the stage. I am a bit arrogant. Later, I wake up and then fall back into this dream. Only this time, we are in the next morning and we have to have our pictures taken. I am wearing a sexy black strapless dress that curls provocatively over my full breasts. I look down and notice my nipples are showing and try to readjust the dress. I head for the bathroom and some woman says, \"Don't forget, don't eat or drink anything before the pictures\" (like a nurse would say before a test of some kind). I say, \"But I can go pee, right?\" She agrees. I go in and try to pee, but can't. A woman opens the door and closes it. I get up and go out, headed for the stage area. I want to hurry and get the picture over with so I can change into my drummer suit (male) and play. I again notice my nipples are showing and readjust. I think, \"Maybe I should change now. It wouldn't do for my mother to see me dressed like this.\" I joke, \"Maybe I should hold my hands like this,\" over the breasts to cover them; it looks silly. The woman comedian from the community college is there and saying she just can't do this. She's going to give up and not do a picture. I shrug, a quitter.

They quote me $250. I agree and get out of the chair. I follow Merle into an elevator and he says I should stick with him or I will get lost. There are stairways and places I could take a wrong turn. He's walking, sort of, now too. We get to the top floor and see Bonnie, who is taking classes at the University where we are. She goes on her way. I now follow Merle to a stairwell, looking for the elevator, but can't find it. I end up in a room where a couple of workers are. They show me my wheelchair and I say, \"Wait, where are my extenders?\" (for the foot pedals, only I am looking for tip rods or extended brake levers). They have misplaced them and now sort of look around in confusion, not trying very hard. I get annoyed, and start walking around, looking for them. I see my old chair and start to take my things out of a fanny pack on the side arm. Then I want to take the fanny pack off too. I have trouble, so this guy comes up to help. I am now standing next to a good-looking man in his forties. He has beautiful blue eyes, wrinkles on his face and wears workman jeans. He stands close to me, smiling, and he tries to stand taller. He's a few inches taller than I am, which pleases me. I like a man that height. As we chit chat, he holds my hand and I smile like a teenager in love. We talk about wheelchair games and other wheelchair people and how good they are at athletics. Even when he needs to do some detail work, he holds my hand. I don't want to break the connection. The other co-workers are looking at us askance. They are surprised and grinning. Merle shows up again to lead me back. I reluctantly let go of Nathan's hand. We part and I follow Merle, aware of Nathan watching as I walk well, seeming not to need a wheelchair. There is no elevator, so Merle says, \"Go this way, but be careful of swinging things that could hit your head.\" \"What?\" I exclaim, \"...then I won't go that way.\" I try to see my way out but decide I'd try the other way instead. I look in and see he means a series of metal things in triangular shapes on a conveyor belt. There is steam there as well, and it is close to where I enter the door. I hesitate, watching, and then ducking in, holding my hand up to protect my face. After I'm in, I see there is no more danger and I walk to a stack of boxes I slide down like they are giant stairs. I'm pretty adept and agile and hope Nathan is watching. Merle is jealous. I ask Merle about Nathan, saying, \"He seems like a nice guy.\" Merle mumbles something and I ask him to repeat it three or four times. I finally figure out he said, \"Nathan has just joined the gay community.\" \"Just my luck,\" I mutter, feeling ripped off. I find my chair among many others and ask for the bill. They say $450. \"What?\" I ask frustrated. They shrug and wait. I say, \"You quoted me $250.\" They shuffle and look embarrassed. I am angry. They did it to me again; they snookered me in. I wait, feeling like a turd for insisting they give the tires at the price they quoted me. After all, they did so much work, but I'm feeling it is unfair to me.

I know I wasn't perfect but that I had made some progress. I lined up. And older lady, a stranger who was sometimes my mother, was saying who got to go down the waterfall. I wanted to go down with no hands all the way. When I finally got to the bottom it was time to down the falls again. It was fun sliding down, but a long walk back up and so very steep. I carried some sheet music with me. 12 sheets with exercises and scripts. I went past the cliff and to the overpass. Too many cars were there. I had to get some ice and there were small 8 oz old containers with the ice all frozen together. A few have three ice cubes and six ice cubes and are melting, a few, and the lady at the counter said, \"Here, why don't you take this?\" and it was 2 huge trash can lids, beige plastic; put together and filled with ice. I didn't know how to carry it. There was a dance--and a play being rehearsed behind a wall. Empty chairs were lined up but nobody could see anything. People were sitting on the bed--4 people. Dora was trying to talk to Marion Woodman. The dance was in a circle and also divided into 2 sections. One was full. The other was space. Dora was sitting with a cereal box upside down over her head--a kind of kids' cereal that doesn't exist anymore. She had eye holes cut out. To see. I was dancing, sometimes in rhythm, sometimes not. They played the B-52's J(song) Rock Lobster and the dance floor was filled with rocking chairs. I didn't rock I danced slower to the slow-down part till I curled up on the floor. We were at the grocery store, me and Dora and Meredith, and we were looking for on-sale desserts. Most were the cheap yucky kind. We wanted to get something for my father, but I had a feeling it was for us too. Cakes went around on a vertical turntable. Some had pictures--one had a carousel but messed it up with stupid Cindarella-ish stuff. Some were green. I was holding 2 very small almost deformed tomatoes in my hand. At the dance Jo Anne Brownlee asked me to tell her what happened to Dora. I went back into the dance to get Dora to help me tell her. Then I went outside and sat in a chair and waited.

Before my appointment was over it was almost time for Mass. I told her I just had one other thing I would like to discuss with her briefly after Mass if possible. She said that was not a problem at all. We went to Mass in the chapel. Bryan N was there. I acted as though I didn't see him as I didn't want to interact with him in anyway. There are no kneelers in the chapel. When it came time in the Mass to kneel Bryan N sat down in his chair. When he saw the rest of us kneel on the floor he did the same. After Mass I stayed in the chapel waiting for him to leave, again so I wouldn't have to risk interacting with him in any way. I was getting impatient because he was waiting so long. He was the last one, besides me in the chapel. Sister Toni came in and he said something to her about meeting her somewhere to go someplace together. This made me very uncomfortable and a little bit upset, though I know I had no reason or right to be upset by this. It felt a bit as though she was taking sides or betraying me, which I know is ridiculous. I went back to her office to wait for her. Just outside her office she had a very small, enclosed, grassy area. I was looking out the window and noticed a path across the middle of the area that looked like it had been made by two tires very close together. The grass was completely gone and the dirt was slightly raised between the two tire tracks. It was only a few feet long so I thought this was very bizarre. There wasn't enough room for anything with tires to even be in there let alone wear such a path in the grass. Then I noticed something similar at one end of the area. I was going to ask her what happened to her grass. I sat and waited and saw her out in the main area doing something. She seemed to either be putting some things away from Mass or preparing for something else, maybe both. She finally saw me in my office and remembered that she had told me could talk a few more minutes after Mass. She said she would be right in. I kept waiting and waiting. I couldn't decided whether to keep waiting or to go ahead and leave. Most of the time I couldn't see her out there so I wasn't even sure she was still out there.

They were all very extremely UGLY. The only one of any merit was the bathing suit made out of wood that looked like an Eskimo totem pole but I thought it would not be good to swim in. The lady said, \"Go try this on.\" And I followed her and... She yelled, \"NO! Go in there and take your clothes off and lay down on the floor.\" She would then hold up the bathing suit next to you to see if it fit. It was the store's new shoplifting prevention policy. Since $15 was only enough for the sale rack I went to another department. On the way I pumped some lotion from a display counter and put it on my arms and legs. I saw the signs and a stretched out beach towel in mid-air--it was a gimmick. The sign said, \"Fake Male Model Beach Towel $262. Get 2 for $300.\" I thought it was very overpriced, though it was a nice, thick, white beach towel. I was life guarding and it was boys' swim and there were little boys under the age of 12.

The streaks were the width of tiger claws where they sliced into the man's flesh.

After a long wait for her return, I am worried. I call the Manager of the hotel and ask him to help me find Mary. We are in a nonsmoking section of the restaurant. Some men take a table close to ours and all of them light up cigars or cigarettes and the smell is terrible. The Manager, who is very kind, goes over to those men and gives them a severe tongue lashing. I am very embarrassed. Then he seats us at another table. I have the impression that Maria and Adam are also in the hotel, but I'm not worried about them. I suggest to the Manager that he send a female staff person into the ladies' washroom to search for Mary. He thinks that's an excellent idea, and also suggests that we look elsewhere for her by ourselves. The manager then leads me on a long search for Mary. We go through a tunnel under the hotel and out into the street. He leads me to an address where he was sure we will find Mary. But when we get to this address, I discover that it is a small ladies' wear store. It is managed by 2 or 3 older women. They know nothing of Mary's whereabouts and are quite cool and indifferent to our inquiries. They just want us to leave them alone and go away. So we start to search again for Mary. The dream ends here. During our walk through the tunnel, somehow I received a phone call, or communication, from a woman (who is not Mary). She may be the woman sent by the manager to look for Mary in the ladies' washroom. Perhaps she is reporting to me on what she found. This woman is laughing and joking and I am amused. But I have the impression that I don't know what she's talking about because I can't hear her voice clearly. Also water is dripping on us in this part of the tunnel which is very narrow.

They have their own way of life and everything, they've done nothing to harm anybody, these humans are just bent on taking over and enslaving the little guys because they're little and they think the little guys aren't as good as them. [I don't know for sure if this is another planet but I sort of think it is.] The ones I'm meeting come, quietly, stealthy, and we talk about what to do. (I'm not alone, I think, there's another person with me - it may be Lori.) We go into the building we're next to - it's a sort of warehouse, and there are rows of storage shelving with things on them. It's dark except for occasional lights on the wall, meant as sort of night-lights or security, I guess - the whole place is dim and has a mysterious, suspense-drama look. The enemy is somewhere in here, they're coming this way, looking for the little people they know are in here. We spread out and get ready. Suddenly they're upon us, and a battle starts.

They're pleased with themselves, thinking they've won again, and start setting up tables and equipment for a meal, they're going to celebrate. [Gradually the character of this scene changes. The \"military\" people become people I work with, the warehouse becomes the library, and the meal they're setting up becomes a catered dinner for the staff.] There's a table right in the middle where some people are already sitting, and I wonder if maybe I should sit there, or are they expecting somebody else they know? I hesitate, and don't want to draw too much attention to myself. This looks like the head table and maybe that's where I should be to hear the most, but I might be conspicuous. Then someone suggests that we can both sit together at this other table, the last one in the corner. Good, fine, we go there, sitting at the far end*. There's a lot of conversation, we're all having a pretty good time, but I'm getting hungry, we've been waiting for them to let us know the food's ready. At some point this table's developed walls around it, it's in a side room. Finally we decide it's been long enough, and venture out to see what's going on. By George, everybody else is eating! We'd better get started. First we come to a sort of appetizer bar where a blondish woman is serving dips and crackers. It's pretty depleted. I take a little plate and get a few crackers, dunking some of them into a white dip. Not very exciting, but a start I guess. (The server also looks bored and unaccommodating.) Nearby I can see a salad bar but I want some more substantial food, so I go on around this station (which is backed up to a wall of sorts - the whole place is sort of an open hall with partitions, and I couldn't see past the appetizers) to where there are tables for the rest of the food. But they're taking it away, most of the tables are cleared already! I'm horrified and furious. I go up and ask what the hell they're doing, we haven't eaten yet. This thing's not supposed to be over for another (20 min? 2 hrs? I'm not sure), either, they can't do this.

And when I was swimming in the water, wouldn't you know, it started to rain. And we were gathering up all our stuff and we were going to run and seek shelter. And, wouldn't you know, the boat was anchored and for some reason it had this odd back-up alarm kind of sound that would go off if you left it unattended for too long. Wouldn't you know it started happening, and Mom had to go and shut that off. And we were getting to pack it up and bring it home, I think, and I think we packed it up and brought it home because of the rain. And then, when we got it home, I think parts of it kind of got scattered all over the house. I think Mom put the boat in the bathtub outside [laugh] and for some reason the motor and other parts got put on the old sleeping couch, where the organ is now in the living room. And some other kind of piece got put in my bathroom upstairs in my tub. [laugh] That was pretty crazy. And so I think maybe in this dream they were going to work on the boat motor or something and I didn't want to be around to hear it because it is so loud. And so I decided I was going to make myself disappear, and in this dream -- not literally, you know -- I was going to take a walk.

I can't get a sense of the building I was in. Normally I would be either in the grade school, church offices, or in Shalom House. This was more like a very large, 3-4 story school or. It reminds me of Goodman Hall at SMW. I went into Alice S's office. It was very tiny and uncomfortable to me because it was so small and crowded. It had her desk and some shelves and filing cabinets, two sitting chairs with a table between them and another very small desk also. Alice S was in there. I had asked her something and she was printing a copy or getting a paper for me or for someone else. I'm not sure. The gentleman that works in her office at that very small desk was working at his laptop computer. His name was Scott. He closed it up and left. For some reason I had the sense that he wasn't going to be working there anymore. I asked Alice S what happened to Scott. She said, shh, like we shouldn't talk about it. I sat down in one of the chairs while I was waiting for her. She sat down at her desk and another man came in and started talking to her. He completely ignored me or didn't even see me there. He was standing right in front of me with his back to me and started asking her something. Then he left and a woman came in and actually closed the door behind her. She said, hi boss. Can I have ten minutes of your time? This was an older woman. She looked at me but completely ignored me and didn't say a word to me. Finally Alice S looked at me apologetically and said, would you mind? I said, why don't you give me one of your cards and I'll email you. My tone of voice showed my frustration. I was searching around her desk to pick up a card but I couldn't find one. She said, no, why don't you call me because I wouldn't want this to get lost among a bunch of emails. I said, fine again with the tone of voice. I was very perturbed that I had been there and these other people came in and ignored me and I was the one that kept getting put off. I went ahead and left. I was trying to find my way out of this building. There was also a young boy who seemed to be trying to find his way out as well. I don't know what happened to him as the dream progressed. I finally thought, if I go to the basement I will know my way from there. I went to the basement and then I started going up these escalators. They were not normal escalators but only 1\/3 or _ as many steps as a normal one and they seemed to move a bit differently as well. These made me even more uncomfortable than the ones in waking life do. It was like you had to move especially quickly and carefully at the top to get off. I finally got up to this one floor and for some reason I got a wheelchair and was pushing it. I had to get through this one area and had these lines of people like you might see at a bank if there were many tellers and each had their own line. In every line there was at least one person sitting in a wheelchair and I had to get across the front of these people. Most of the people in the wheelchairs were being very nice about it. They had to back up a bit to make room for me to get through with this empty wheelchair. I kind of brushed up against a couple of them and apologized. I finally got through. For some reason it seems that I took the empty wheelchair just so I could get through. Someone asked me to take this woman in a hospital bed to her new room. She was being transferred to another room. I must have been at SVH. I realized later that I was. They didn't tell me what floor this woman needed to go to and she didn't know either. I stopped at this one place that was kind of like a snack bar window. I asked if they could make a call to find out where she was supposed to be. The manager was being very uncooperative. One of the male employees asked the manager if it was okay to offer the patient some free ice cream. He said that was fine and asked her if she would like some. She said yes so the employee gave her some vanilla soft serve ice cream in a cardboard bowl. I sat her up in her bed and she was eating her ice cream. While we were sitting there these younger adults came up. I thought I recognized the one woman but I didn't say anything. They were relatives of this woman in bed. They were surprised to see her and they chatted for a little while. Somewhere around this point she told me that she was fine and was actually there to do volunteer work. I don't know why she was in this hospital bed. I said, well, I'll tell you what though. Let's have you stay in the bed that way we will be able to get through these different floors without people questioning us. It will be easier for us to go through the various places in the hospital to find out where you are supposed to be. She agreed to that. I then said, let's start at the third floor because that makes most sense to me as far as a place to start. After she finished her ice cream and finished talking to her relatives I had her lay back down and I took her up to the 3rd floor. I went through a couple of departments and a couple of them said that this patient wasn't theirs. we went into this one area like a small pharmacy. I was having trouble maneuvering this bed around in there because the aisles were so narrow and short. While we were in there a doctor came running in yelling tube, tube, tube. He ran in a pulled a tube in a plastic wrapper off the shelf, ripped it open and just dropped the wrapper, and ran back out and down the hall. There were maybe 4 or 5 more doctors who came running down the hall towards us. They had blood all over them and some medical things in their hands. I thought they were running in to us. But I guess they decided they didn't need to. They calmed down and ran around and said yes he was breathing okay and the tube was clear. They went back and she had a concerned look on her face. I said don't worry, it will be okay. They won't have you volunteering any place that is really uncomfortable for you. The doctors that had blood all over them had splatter blood all over her face. I took a towel and gently wiped it off, I recall the most being on her forehead. We went on working our way to some departments trying to find where she was supposed to be. I came across a large male black nurse. I asked him if he could tell me where the admissions office is for this area. He told me where to go. I headed over there. I saw a nurse sitting by a desk. There was a very small newborn. maybe a preemie. next to her. I think it was in an incubator. She was on the phone. When she got off the phone I explained why we were there and that this woman was really fine. I had kept her on the bed so we could get through the various departments to find out where she was supposed to be. She was supposed to be volunteering. The nurse was very nice. She was a younger black female nurse. While we were waiting for her to get off the phone I was wondering if this was the new pediatric unit that SVH has been building, or if it was the new pediatric sleep center. At that point the nurse said the woman could get out of bed and she would take care of it from there. I could just take the bed out. I headed out with the empty bed and came across this male nurse again. He said he was on his way to put back another empty bed so I could just follow him. I jokingly said, oh, you were supposed to give me a ride now. He just laughed. He went really fast and I couldn't keep up with him so I was practically running to keep up with him. I guess staff thought I was playing with the empty bed or something because they were all looking at me and grinning. I saw Doctor C at the end of the hall so I aimed it at him like I was going to run into him. When I got up to him I stopped to say hello. His hair was completely gray. He spoke very briefly, but friendly. Just not what I expected after not seeing him for a year. I thought he would seem happier to see me.

Mark is gentle and sweet but somewhat distant. I tell him congratulations for getting the handicapped coordinator job at the community college and tell him I used to be that. I tell him he can call on me any time if he needs help or has questions. I do that to leave an opening so we could get together, if he wanted. Now I am at home. Mark and his sister and his cat come to visit. We all chat. Mark is shy, but seems to like me. I like him too. I hold his cat and the cat is loving and cuddles gently in my arms. It's as though I am holding him (Mark). This is a good sign. This means the cat, who is fussy, likes me a lot. This is important to Mark and his sister. Now they are leaving and I walk them out to the porch. Only now Mark is seated, semi laying down on a porch seat. I sit down near him and we talk. I look past him and see a huge river with lots of people playing and swimming. He asks me to describe the scene to him. I tell him it is a pleasant Sunday afternoon where people are all out to enjoy the wonderful weather and have fun. I tell him about four fat men who each stand ten feet apart and at a signal all fall in backwards into the river; the kids swimming and playing. A sled that looks like a snow sleigh goes by, with red painted trim. I describe that. A convertible car with no engine or hood in the front goes by, crawling over the couches near the bank. The driver is concerned that water is splashing into the empty place where the engine would be. He wants his spiffy car to stay spiffy. I say to him, \"I'm sorry,\" thinking I helped splash some water. Then I say to Mark, \"I'm always telling people I'm sorry.\" Mark and I are getting physically closer, our arms brushing each other. It is gentle and loving and shy. We are very attracted to each other. Mark tells me of his house, which is his but it's his mother's and his family is very important to him. Then I notice the river level is dropping. All of a sudden, the entire water contents of the river drain away and everyone falls to the bottom, including us. A man tells us that the water will be gone for one or two hours. I look up and see the man on a high balcony by a metal railing. The sun is warm and bright. I am looking up at him but aware I am shyly avoiding looking into Mark's eyes. I have Mark, a quad, folded up in my arms and I stand up and start walking, carrying him. The way is rough, stones, debris and boulders. It makes walking hard, but I am managing well. I get back up near the house and Mark says, \"My brother left a taped message in your van for you.\" I laugh and say, \"Then let's go hear it.\" We go back toward the van.","character":"1MKA, 1MSA, 1FKA, 2MSA, 1ANI","emotion":"AP 1MKA, AP 1MKA","text_len":2849,"word_count":575},{"id":"kenneth","name":"Kenneth","number":"0320","time":"1996-1998","date":"07\/29\/1996","gender":"M","age":"Y","text":"<i>Young Black Women At Robbins<\/i> <br\/><br\/> I am going by my neighbor the Robbins' house, either walking or on a bicycle.

We looked in and didn't understand. Lights were on, nothing was happening. The man told us to go in and follow the lights; he'd turned most of them off. I and two other girls went in.  Walking through the house (it wasn't a ride, but a real house, seemingly abandoned) the story of three girls was chronicled. We were 'in the role' of these three girls who came exploring the house. The girls had different perspectives on the house, one kidding and being very sarcastic, the others afraid, that sort of thing, so the friendship was at risk. Walked in the front door, through the kitchen off to the left.  Some of what happened is unclear, but in the last room they'd been separated for a short time and didn't trust each other anymore.  Everything that had happened in the story originally was happening again- we didn't trust each other.  The last part we didn't play in, but simply watched from above. One of the girls wanted to leave; one was not allowing her to. The other came out from another room bleeding. The other ran for the door and the dominant one stopped her with a knife. Finally help arrived...the one who tried to escape had gaping wounds up and down her body and was carried out on a gurney. They all left hurt, somehow a victim of the house.  Upon exiting I thought the thing was pretty neat, how we actually, unknowingly did take on the roles of the girls and feel what they had felt.  I talked to the guy running the house, asking about how it was done, or something. He had creepy looking blue eyes. In response to my question he took me through it from the back entrance to show how it was done. I think we were in a car of some sort. In any case, we were talking, and it looked as though he had wire bristles in his mouth, like some sort of bug.  Going through the tunnel back into the house something outside the car brushed against my breasts. I kept talking with the guy.  We started kissing. There were no wire bristles, but his tongue had fork tines on it.

Luna ended up moving and I didn't get a photo. There was a pet shop section and there was a cute dog, sleeping. At first I thought it was a cat, and then it woke up and its ears went 'dog like' and it jumped out of the pigeon hole and started getting excited. I felt bad but gave it a pat and then went on my way. Mom went missing. The guy who ran the place was really shifty and I suspected something else was going on here. I grabbed Rover on a lead and went looking for her. Mom's name was 'Claire', so I was calling that as out as well. There was a group of people in this 'well', and I peeked in to see if she was there. They all disappeared, but she wasn't part of it. I kept walking and then I saw her leaning against a half wall as part of a walkway. She was the woman from American Horror Story. Her face had been disfigured and she was blind. I ran over with Rover and said 'it's Mom', but when she talked her voice sounded different (croaky and scratched), and he didn't seem to recognise her. This upset her, but I kept insisting to Rover it was Mom and he started warming up to it. She asked how bad her face was and I said it was pretty badly disfigured. I went back to the house place to find the guy. Apparently he was taking the occasional person and turning them into 'ghosts', but not really ghosts, and they would be like his slaves. I found him in a kitchen and he told me to follow him and when he walked out, I grabbed a knife and put it in my pocket. I lost him, but I was going through tunnels and one tunnel passed the back of a stage, so I walked through the curtains and he was standing on it and said 'ah, the stage ending! Only 50% of players get this far' and he gave me this sharp pointy thing. I thought it was a trick weapon, so I took out my knife and started stabbing him with it. I then used the sharp pointy thing (which was hook like) and slit his throat (it barely cut the surface). But he just lay there on the floor and it healed. I was like what. Then Mom was there too and had been healed too (it was the place?). I demanded we be let go, but he just laughed. We ran and got outside where all his 'ghost slaves' were and they went after us. He said he was going to take Rover and Mom begged him to take her instead of him and the ghost slaves just grabbed her and pulled her inside.","character":"1FKA, 1MKA, 1ANI, 2JSA, 1FSA","emotion":"AP D","text_len":2931,"word_count":598},{"id":"natural_scientist","name":"The Natural Scientist","number":"187","time":"1939","date":"09\/25\/39","gender":"M","age":"A","text":"On a fairly flat strip of ground bordering a river.

I don't know who else was there, maybe Mom and Dad, maybe Lynn.  It seemed like we were moving things around.  Then we left.  Then we had to drive back to the cabin.  There was some urgency.  Mom was driving my truck.  We came up a road, and there was some obstruction or delay.  I must have gotten out to walk or solve the problem.  I decided to walk or run by another route, and Mom kept going the regular road.  It seemed as she drove off, she gave me a disgusted look, like she was frustrated with the traffic or obstruction.  I took a higher path, it was rockier, big boulders, and it went uphill and wound around.  I knew where I was going, I thought I would meet Mom when the forks came together again, or meet her at the place we had been going to.  It was just a different way to get there, rockier.  I ran on this path.  I came to an overlook, above a valley.  It dropped off really steep and high.  It looked like Spanish Bottom in The Maze.  I stopped at the rocks at the edge, looking for the path.  I had been here before and I knew the path went under an overhang, but I couldn't remember exactly where.  I bent a little to look for where the path came out under the overhang.  Then about three guys came up behind me.  One said, \"When we get here, what do we do?  We go over the cliff like this!\"  And he picked me up and held me out over the cliff.  I was really scared, I did not know if he was going to drop me the few feet down to the path below or what.  Then he threw me out off the cliff.  I was hundreds of feet above the ground, like at Spanish Bottom.  I soared through the air and got that sick feeling of dropping hundreds of feet.  I knew there must be a river here below me.  In mid-air, I looked at the landscape below, searching for the river.  And then I saw the Colorado River, very dark, below me.  I hoped I would hit it.  But I knew from this height I would probably die even if I hit the river.  And I wasn't sure how to steer myself to hit the river.  The Colorado was almost black, so dark colored.  It looked like the Colorado river area just before Castle Valley area.  I woke up before I hit, still in mid-air.","character":"1FKA, 1MKA, 2MSA","emotion":"AP D, AN 1MKA","text_len":2190,"word_count":434},{"id":"vietnam_vet3","name":"Vietnam Vet: 2016-17 dreams","number":"0110","time":"2016-2017","date":"2016-11-08","gender":"M","age":"A","text":"I'm with a group of young people hiking in the mountains.

Her husband comes in unexpectedly - he is a very unpleasant man, and Karen is very uncomfortable - you could say she even looks scared, and it's apparently because I'm there - she's not supposed to have visitors, it seems, and he is very disapproving.

One of them, on the left, is a sort of spire, or extremely large spike. It's metal, dark, pointed at the top, wider at the bottom, and there's something at the bottom that looks like a small dog lying on its back with its head away from me and its feet up, almost as if it were impaled on the spike. Another, smaller dog, a puppy, is standing in front of it (and the not dissimilar piece next to it), barking. This whole thing is up on a ledge or platform almost at eye level.

Then suddenly it moves, kicks its back legs up as if it was trying to pull free, to get up. It is real! Oh hell. Oh, hell. I don't want to believe this. He's actually impaled a dog on this thing, because he thinks it's art. Oh, hell. It goes through my mind to rescue it, but how in the world could I possibly do anything that would help?

Last night I had a dream that I was at this theme park, and I can remember bits and pieces of it. Bad me -- I let it drag on until it's 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon now, but I didn't have time to record it this morning when I first woke up. So I dreamt that I was at a theme park with Melinda, and it was kind of a school field trip like type thing. And there was this ride called the Kumba Roller Coaster -- it was either the Kumba or the Montu -- it was kind of like Six Flags. And we'd go on this roller coaster and we'd roller coaster around. It would be an \"Ahhhhhhhhhh!\" thrill ride. There was also this ride that I liked that was a slide that would like spray you with water as you were sliding down this big, tall slide, and you'd hear these really cool sounds as you were going by, like it had a really neat sound system, which that and spraying water just don't go together, but maybe they did. I think I heard something like that at some kind of theme park, and that's where I got the idea from. And once you got down to the bottom of this big slide, you'd fall into this swimming pool that was really deep and you like swam to the other end, and that was okay. And we only had a little bit of time left, but I wanted Melinda to go on this slide with me, and she said, \"No, no, I'm too chicken; you have to go by yourself.\" And so I went, but it was kind of funny because the slide wouldn't spray me with the water and there was no sound. All that it was, was that you could slide down the slide and that was it. And I imagined in my dream that this slide was pink and that the pool was pink, instead of blue like they usually are. And so, sorry folks, the tape is coming to an end. I will start over on the next one. Alright, I don't expect this tape to last me more than about a month's worth of material, maybe even less, but it's just a junky marketing tape anyway, and it's no good for anything else, and this is better than having it thrown in the garbage. So, let us begin! I am going to start over and repeat a dream that I wasn't able to fit on the last tape. It is now close to 9:00 o'clock at night and I am kind of fortunate that even part of it has stayed with me this long because I just didn't have the time to do it this morning. So anyway, I dreamt that I was at this amusement park, and I was there with Melinda, and it was kind of like Six Flags, except in my dream it didn't really have a name. And we were like on this school field trip and her and I were kind of running around together, and I think everybody else kind of just ditched us. And we were like running around going on these rides. There was this huge, open park picnic area in the middle of the park that kind of reminded me of Westport College Quad, except that it had like picnic tables and stuff and like amusement park type fencing and white-colored tables. And there was this one ride that was like the Mod II or the Kumba, and it was just a roller coaster. You would have to walk up very high to get to it though, like a boardwalk; you'd have to climb stairs and go up ramps and snakes and winds, kind of like you have to do when you're at a theme park, except this was all in the open and on a like a wooden boardwalk. And I wanted to get Melinda to go on that, and I think maybe we did, but I have no memory of actually being on a ride. Then there was this other ride that I really, really liked supposedly, and it was supposedly a pink slide that you would slide down and it would spray you with water from the side, and you'd hear these really cool sounds as you'd be going by. Now spraying water and a cool sound system don't exactly go together, but, you know, in theme parks sometimes they may have everything all water-tight. And I was trying to get Melinda to go down this slide with me because we only had a little bit of time left and I wanted to make us do this before we had to go. And the slide was pink and I went down it; she was too chicken. And it didn't spray and the water and it didn't make the sounds. It was just like a slide, because I think the park was like going to close, but I didn't feel like it was. And then I like landed in this pool of water, like you would expect at most theme park rides, slide things, and when I first landed in it, the pool had a pink bottom instead of a blue bottom like they usually do. And then as I was swimming behind this other girl, and I became aware that I was swimming over like a grate venting and my feet were about to touch the bottom, then the pool turned blue like they usually are. And you know how in dreams when you dream about swimming, or at least I do, the water like tosses you around and you like, you sink to the bottom as though gravity were holding you down, but you can still breathe by some miracle? This is how I always dream when I dream about swimming in a pool. I don't know why. Usually the water wants to pull me up because I'm a female and I have the female fat buoyancy thing. Dad just sinks like a rock. But anyway, I have to really fight to get down and stay down if I want to dive under water, but in my dream I just sort of sink and I can still breathe. [laugh] But anyway, enough of that. And so, I don't know how I got myself like all dried off and everything in such a hurry, but we went back to this like classroom that was at the theme park and there was a TV, they were going to show a movie. And I was kind of thinking, \"I want to sit where I can see the movie,\" because I thought it was going to be halfway interesting, but Melinda said, \"Nah, nah, let's sit over here in this section where we can goof around and nobody will see us!\" And it was close to one of those like candy machines that they have at Westport College. And before anything else could happen, I woke up.","character":"1FKA","emotion":null,"text_len":5843,"word_count":1190},{"id":"izzy-all","name":"Izzy (ALL, including non-consecutive)","number":"4292","time":"2003-2016","date":"2016-06-11 (25)","gender":"F","age":"TY","text":"I'm not sure where I was, but there was this huge toilet with stalls in the middle of the room.

There was also in the dream a playhouse attached to the hotel. For some reason they were having a play and one of the cast was not able to participate, and I somehow took his place. The play that was being presented was Hamlet, and I was to play Hamlet's brother. That night that the play took place, only the first act was presented and the next two acts were to be presented the next night. I didn't remember the actual play at all. I do remember immediately after the play. Two of the young owners of the hotel, Barbara and Bernie, came back stage and were congratulating everyone, and they especially looked to me and said something to the extent that, \"You did a great job. We're very proud of you,\" or something like that. At this the star of the play turned to me with a very jealous and enraged look on his face, but at this moment the curtain went up for another bow. The audience was cheering quite loudly, and myself and the star took our bows. Then we presumed that that was the last curtain call, and I started to look around for my jacket. It was a green jacket. I couldn't seem to find it. I also remember seeing the audience very clearly as a large group of people. I was looking for my jacket and finally I suppose it was about five minutes later and the theater had pretty much cleared out, and I opened the curtains thinking it might have been left in the orchestra pit or something, and there was a small row of boys left still cheering for some reason. Must have been about 12 of them all sitting very closely together, and there in the orchestra pit I did find my jacket lying on top of the piano. While I was taking one of my curtain calls, a woman in the audience spoke up and asked me if I was a graduate student or an actor, and I said I was only an actor as a hobby. I took this as a rather flattering question. In the beginning of this dream there was something else that preceded this, but in trying to remember the dream while I was still apparently in a sleep-like state, I was trying to recount the events of the dream and just before I started them, I dreamt that Dr. Hall came into my room and said something to the effect that, \"Roger, I hear you have a dream.\" I said, \"Yes, I'm trying to remember it now,\" or something like that, and he somewhat indicated to me that he knew some of the contents of the dream, that he had them typed out on a card, and this rather amazed me because at this point I felt if this was so, then he must have sent them to me by ESP. Having recovered from my amazement, I said, \"Well, I'm going to have to try to recall the dream now to get it nice and clear,\" and I went on to recall the dream, but 10 minutes later I woke up, fully awoke, so apparently this episode was either part of re-dreaming the dream a second time in an attempt to recall it or possibly it was just an additional part of the dream. It's very hard to say. Many of the events that I have described are real life settings such as my having been a waiter at the Seaside Hotel in Atlantic City. In fact, there was a playhouse, not attached to it, but right next to it. It belonged to another hotel and a friend of mine was in a play there, but none of this is really day residue although it all comes from memories of the past.","character":"1MOA, 1MPA, 2JSA, 1FSA, 2MSA, 1FSA","emotion":"AN 1MKA","text_len":3367,"word_count":658},{"id":"madeline1-hs","name":"Madeline 1: High School","number":"0102","time":"1997-2000","date":"2000-10-07 (HS)","gender":"F","age":"T","text":"I was back at school.  My old friend Candy was there, watching the kids her mom used to babysit, Lily and Rob.  There was a sort of tunnel in the back (where the front is) of the library.  She had to go in to get one of them.  I had to go into one of the science rooms in C-Hall in order to do something towards testing my little fridge for college.  I guess the fridge itself was there.  I tried the ice cube tray, and put some water in a bottle with lotion in order to test the freezing capabilities.  I had to get my eyes checked for some reason.  When I was done with the fridge, I went in.  My 10th grade history teacher Mr. March was the one doing the testing.  He was with someone; I was sitting and waiting.  I thought to ask him if he'd prefer me to leave, to which he replied with a prompt and irritated affirmative.  I saw some results of what letters the man had thought were displayed, and when I left he was squinting with one eye, and looking at a blue laser picture of a man with a hat on.  I was called in.  I sat (lay) down.  There was a small metal dish mounted in the corner, with various size holes in it.  He shined the blue laser at it, moving it around, first in a circle, then back and forth...I thought my job was to guess where it was focusing; at which hole was it closest.  That was not the case.  He asked me why it looked the way it did.  I was fairly clueless, but made a couple guesses.  He impatiently and coldly told me I was wrong, and explained it, as if I should have known.  Then I was to identify the shape drawn with the blue laser; it was the man in a hat, his face showing on both sides.  I was explaining the faces I saw when he cut me off and spun the chair around.  His voice began to reveal a wicked German or Austrian sort of accent.  He asked me another question, disinterested.  He rolled up my left pant leg and told me to put my leg in the brace (looked like a used cast).  I did, but I started asking him what he was doing, I was getting very nervous.  \"What are you doing, my knees are fine! You don't need to...\"  He just told me to shut up and let him work.  He was doing something with a motorized gadget; somehow I knew he was cutting the skin flap off of my kneecap, even though I didn't feel anything.  I tried to struggle a little, but not much so I wouldn't get hurt worse.  I didn't know why I didn't feel it, or why he was doing it.  The chair was rotating in circles.  Finally he stopped.  I felt a sort of numb pain rush to the area of my knee.  \"It'll hurt for the next 14 hours,\" he said.  And I awoke with that same numb pain.","character":"1FKA, 2JKA, 1FKA, 1MSA, 1MSA","emotion":"AN 1MKA","text_len":2595,"word_count":519},{"id":"elizabeth","name":"Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s","number":"0275","time":"1999-","date":"2001-08-21","gender":"F","age":"A","text":"I'm at the Holiday Inn at MI. I check in at the front desk. I go to get on the elevator. I had a garbage bag of clothes to be donated to Goodwill or someplace. As I was standing there waiting for the elevator two men come and stand right in front of me for the elevator. One of them has a cart and the other has a trash bag larger than mine. I told them, you know if there isn't room on the elevator after you two get on that I will be mad at you. They kind of stepped to the side and the elevator opened so I went in first. Then we don't have our trash bags anymore but there are quite a few people on the elevator. The elevator car is pretty full. It starts making noises. It is kind of jerky and moves side-to-side. Everyone is pretty nervous. I was thinking, I want to get out of here. I need to get out of here. We are headed to the 6th floor. It doesn't stop and it goes back down again. I get off at the second floor thinking that. I don't know if I didn't realize that I was not on the 5th floor. I started walking to find my room. There were several large businesses having meetings out in this open area instead of in meeting rooms. I had to walk by them to get to my room. I'm looking at them trying to figure out what the companies were. I realized one of them is LRJ. I saw Carol H. She saw me and calls out to me, then comes over to where I am standing. We say hello and hug and chat a little bit. She looks a little different, like she had gained a little weight and she was wearing glasses. We had a nice chat and she said she had to get back to her meeting. I need to go find my room so I walked away. I am trying to find my room and I realize I don't remember my room number, I don't have my key with me and I don't have my luggage. I asked someone where 650 or 620 are. They tell me I am on the second floor. That is when I realized I am not on the right floor. I had to walk past these meetings again. There is very little room to walk through. There are people sitting at the ends of the table but not up next to the table. So I had to walk between them and the table. I keep walking. One of the groups is having a sit-down dinner. At two of these tables the women are having mashed potatoes and gravy. They put potatoes right on the tablecloth instead of on a plate. I was wearing a white suit. As I walk between these women and the tables to squeeze through I get their mashed potatoes and gravy on my suit. They don't seem to care and don't apologize. One said, well, you can get that out with a little soap and water. I was nice and polite and said, Yes, I can. I went on. I get back to the elevator and really don't want to get back on because I was so scared the last time. There are other people standing there waiting also. There is a row of four elevators. Two of the elevators are standing open but there is camera equipment standing in the open. As the doors try to close they close on this equipment so they can't close all the way. The next things we see are the doors moving side to side. I started thinking Oh no. Here we go again. At first I thought maybe if I got on another elevator it would be okay but I now realize that all four of them have the same problem. I don't remember getting back on or off the elevator. I see Kendall B standing and talking to a group of people. I'm standing there looking for a little bit wondering if it is really him, because he looks a little different. His hair is a little fuller and has streaks of gray. After he finishes speaking he walks up to me and I introduce myself. He said it was nice to meet me. Then another man walks up and introduces me. At that point I realize this is his life partner. I'm talking to the two of them and quite a few children kept coming up to us. I realized it is their children. There were approximately 8-10 of different ages. His partner asked me what I do and I wasn't sure how to answer that because of my unemployment. I talked a little about my dreamwork. I told Kendall B that I had some communication with Doctor Du about the sleep positions so we talked some about that. Then Kendall B was telling me that they were there doing some work and he had to hire someone to help him. He said if I had known that I lived so close by he would have called me. I said that would have been wonderful. I was really disappointed that he hadn't contacted me. His children were doing something with videos and stuff. They were talking about going to their rooms and have TV dinners in their room. There were boxes that looked like they had about 10 videos to a box. Kendall B said, That's what we have to do. I looked at him quizzically because I didn't know what he meant. I asked, What do you have to do? He said, You don't know? I said, No, I don't. Please try to be kind when you answer me, so I don't feel even more stupid for not knowing. I don't think he or his partner either one answered me. The boxes were kind of flat and two rows of five movies each. We are outside. One of their children is reaching through a fence and trying to kill a rabbit. I said Oh no. Please don't do that. I said I have a pet rabbit at home and I would really hate to see you hurt one. So they stopped. Then this rabbit caught another animal, a smaller animal. I thought he was going to kill it to eat it. The rabbit got the animal in a position to where he could bite it in the neck and it died. I hated seeing that. I don't like to see any creature killed and I certainly don't want to witness it. Kendall B or his partner were saying, that's the cycle of nature, trying to make me feel better. Then there was a male on the other side of the fence trying to kill a rabbit. I got upset again. I thought, Please don't do that. He had already killed one but he did let that one go. I said, that kind of looks like Sir Gallahad except those have more white on them. Sir Gallahad is a Mini-Rex and his coat is really soft like chinchilla.","character":"2MSA, 1MSA, 1FKA, 1ISA","emotion":null,"text_len":5925,"word_count":1198},{"id":"b","name":"Barb Sanders","number":"1339","time":"1960-1997","date":"1989-03-26","gender":"F","age":"YA","text":"I'm at a school.

But first in this dream I kind of had the notion that I was riding with Dad in the truck in the middle of the night with my bag of stuff and the Peavey system, and we were going on a long, three-hour trip to do a DJ gig somewhere, but I don't actually remember doing the gig. I don't remember coming home, I don't remember where it was, I just know that I was sort of getting ready. Then Mom and I -- I think I do remember getting home from the gig and Mom had to take me to the DBS office to pick up some paper, and they had this big, huge complex, not just a little office in a big building, like they have. And so we walked over there when we got there, and we were just going to pick up the paper and leave, but Carolyn wanted to talk to me. And somebody else did too, so I can't remember anything about what I said, but I think I said, \"Hi, hello,\" to Carolyn. And then there was this other person. She was kind of younger than Carolyn, but she was a little more kind of uppity like, just a little. And we were going around, I don't remember why, but she gave some kind of direction to Mom. They had this like field area out in the back that was for mobility training, and she wanted Mom and I to walk to it. And it was like a street, like a city street, with like just empty fields and nothing on either side. And how that could be anything big for trade, I don't know. And so we started walking down this road and I realized that there were these -- every so often in certain places, there were these like cover things, but they weren't covered, and half was silver and half was black. And when you would step on them, you would get an electric shock because apparently they wanted to do like conditioning to keep you in the middle of the street. And ever so often there would be one on either side, and if you stepped on it, I guess the silver half was the positive and the black half was the negative. I don't know, you'd have to be between the two of them, because you know how that goes. I think I had my white cane with me that time, and even when it would, when my tip would touch it, I would feel it through my hand, which I don't know why because my tip is plastic and the aluminum part is really insulated really well by the rubber top. I don't know, I guess I just wasn't thinking when I created this dream. And so we were going along, and at first I didn't mind, we were walking along and it was kind of pitch dark and we could see where the street was, but sometimes they'd have them in the middle of our path. Then they got to the point where they weren't just every so often. They were like all over, and they were getting bigger with more voltage on them, so it felt stronger. Mom still didn't mind them, so then she was carrying me over some of them, and she was getting them all and she was going, \"Ooh, ah,\" but she didn't mind them. I was like petrified and she kind of didn't care. And there was no like turning back around and going back because this path was like a circle; it would lead you back to the building. We got back to the building and we had to go upstairs for some reason because there was a bathroom in there, and they had you take a shower after you've been on this trip, if people have any feet yet, if they're not black yet. But, you know, the really wild part, after we were on that trip I noticed that there were a few here or there inside the building, and so by that time I was like afraid to take any step in any one direction because these things, I didn't know where the heck they were and when they were going to pop up. And in some cases, when we would be in the hallway, they wouldn't be there, and sometimes they would just pop up, except in the building they wouldn't be black and silver; they would blend in with whatever was around. And so I never did take my shower as prescribed, but I had to go up and down the elevator, which wasn't just for anybody to use. Somebody had to specially activate it for us, so we went down the stairs a few times too, and we noticed how steep the stairs were. So Mom and I had to make a sign that said, \"Beware, drops off.\" And I was kneeling on one stair and laying on the other, and there was the most awful smell on the stairwell, like gym sweat. And somebody was coming up beside us, and I moved over and left them pass, and I finished my sign and then I stuck it up there. And then we went down the stairs, and then, thank goodness, that fiasco was over. Then my dream continues though, we met up with Dad at the Coliseum and Mom and Dad were conferring outside and I went in and I was giving our information to the person at the desk, like how old am I, how old is the person I'm with, this and that and the other. And it was more like applying for, applying for some kind of government aid just to get into a dance. And the guy said he had a check for me because I had made that long trip and did a Peavey system gig. And so it ended up that I didn't have to pay to get into the dance, but he paid me for something. And so it turned out, just before I woke up, me and Dad and Mom, we sat outside in the lobby and were eating some kind of lunch before the dance really got started. Now what I don't understand is when I was on the DBS mobility trail, the ________ mobility trail, I don't understand why it was totally dark outside and here at the Coliseum it was broad daylight. Oh well, that's one of the aspects of the dream. The next dream stems from a lot of things, the first thing being that I always have had something inside of me about covers, but they've always either just popped up or sprayed water or something. I've never had anything electrical going on. I think it's because now, whenever I handle the Peavey system outside, I'm conscious of it. Even this last time I practiced my speech, I was on the sidewalk and everything was dry, and I was still feeling a little bit of something. So I put on my shoes, and, of course, the fears went away, but still I'm more conscious of that now. And also I don't know where DBS comes into the picture; I guess because I'm becoming more independent lately and some people just don't know how independent I can be, not them, but some people I know. And we had to fill out a long, lengthy f___ application so the guy at the Coliseum desk asking me all those question fits in just fine. And he paying me for a Peavey gig is, I guess, because I got several scholarship checks in the mail, and that's the end of that.","character":"1MKA, 1FKA, 1ISA, 1FSA","emotion":null,"text_len":6562,"word_count":1307},{"id":"norms-f","name":"Hall\/VdC Norms: Female","number":"0395","time":"1940s-1950s","date":null,"gender":"F","age":"Y","text":"In the first part of the dream I was at a ballet school and the walls were covered by mirrors.

Now there is a bed in the room and I sit on it and Richard flirts and we hold hands and roll around playfully. There is some witty repartee as we \"dance\" with a push-pull feeling - like him or not like him, that is the question. My brother Dwight comes in and I try to introduce him to Richard and three other students that had come in late. I can't remember his name and call him Jackie and he corrects me and says Johnny. He's a bit annoyed with me. He gives me two cans of soda and his business card. I see on the card he makes wood toys and a woman says, \"Oh, do you carve them with his knife or your dick?\" He's leaving and retorts, \"You tell me, girl.\" He's out the door and I wisecrack, \"What a cutting remark,\" and laugh. He laughs and is gone. I feel a little badly that my sarcasm could be taken hurtfully (a cutting remark). A student named Nate wasn't going to be in today because his wife or girlfriend was knifed, but he shows up. I want to ask him how his girlfriend is doing, but so much is happening all at once.","character":"1FKA, 1MKA, 2JOA, 1MKA, 1FSA, 1MKA, 1FSA, 1MKA","emotion":"AN 1MKA, AP D","text_len":1374,"word_count":274},{"id":"izzy-all","name":"Izzy (ALL, including non-consecutive)","number":"4075","time":"2003-2016","date":"2014-07-22 (23)","gender":"F","age":"TY","text":"I was watching Big Brother and someone had written some stuff on a piece of paper and it was in the corner of the screen but I saw it had Stalled written on it.

It didn't look like my waking life home, inside or out. I had a basement in this home and outside you had to walk up eight or so steps to get to the front door. I had a Ficus Tree sitting near a door between a hallway and the living room. We had set up some folding chairs to have enough room for people to sit and one of them was sitting across from but very close to this tree, narrowing the walking space from the hallway into the living room. As people went through there they were constantly brushing against the tree and knocking leaves off. At first I was trying to keep them thinking that it was a silk tree and I could just put them back on later. By the end of the afternoon there were only a few branches left that still had leaves on them. Someone started talking about this and I said I was just going to reattach as many of the leaves that I still had so it wasn't a problem. But as I looked at it more I realized that it wasn't silk at all, that it was a live tree. I felt foolish for not knowing this. I realized this because I saw that it was live because the leaves were starting to brown and die from the abuse it had taken all day. I picked it up because it was very light, just like a silk one would be, and turned it a bit sideways and talked to someone about the fact that it was dying. I knew I needed to just dispose of it at this point. Someone offered to take it out to the dumpster for me. I said something to someone about how much larger the room felt without the tree in there. I was trying to be nice but inside I was very sad that my tree had been killed because I had it for so many years prior and I hate it when any of my houseplants die. Without telling me, when they did that they actually decided to chop up the branches and trunk and bring them back in so I could use them for firewood. There much more firewood from it than I would have imagined, with longer and thicker pieces than I thought it had. But it was clean and easy for me to move and manage so I appreciated it. When you came in the front door, you would take a few steps to your left and then there was a wall to your left running vertically in the direction you were facing. It was a short wall and that is where the fireplace was. When facing the fireplace, at the left end of the fireplace was another wall that created a corner, but that wall was a small curve away from the fireplace. I had them set the wood on the floor in front of the fireplace and on the hearth. Matthew asked me if I had ever used that fireplace since we had been living there and I told him I didn't think we had but I love fireplaces and would certainly love to. I was trying to remember why I had never used it. I used the fireplaces in my previous homes quite frequently. We all went downstairs but I don't remember why. I was talking about the fact that I would like to rearrange the furniture and things down there to create several different areas or zones. I wanted a small sitting area where people could just sit and talk or read, an area to watch TV, and an area for games as I had one or two game tables, though I can't remember what kind they were. Bev and Matthew thought it would be fun to help me move things around and see what we could come up with so the other adults decided to help. I immediately thought of three chairs down there that I thought would be best for the sitting area. People brought other chairs over for that area and I was trying to kindly tell them that I didn't think they were the best there. I didn't want to nix everything they tried or be critical when they were willing to help me. We finally agreed on three chairs and a small round table. The table sat against the wall with two chairs flanking it and one facing it and all placed fairly close together so it was a very cozy area where people could talk quietly and still be able to hear each other very well. That part was easy but the rest we kept moving things around and around trying to find something that worked. I seemed to have more than one sofa. There is a somewhat short hallway leading away from the main area of the basement that leads to doctor's offices. I asked what they thought about storing the children's toys along the wall in the hallway across from the office doors. I thought the hallway was wide enough that they wouldn't be in the way and the children could get the toys and bring them into the main area to play rather than playing in the hallway. Still, no one thought that was a good idea. I had walked away for a little bit and when I came back they had placed two sofas in the hall along the same wall as the office doors. It didn't leave very much room to walk through there and I said that there had to be enough room for patients to walk through there to get to the doctors offices. Behind the sofas looks like a huge storage area with all kinds of boxes and stuff sitting there, almost forming a wall behind the sofas. Where the main area met the hallway there was another set of steps leading up to a room or two that were not part of the house where we came down from. Doctor C was up there sleeping. While we were moving things around he came down as he was getting ready to leave for work, to see patients. He was very tired and somewhat grumpy, which wasn't all that unusual. I talked to him briefly as he was fixing his tie. He had on black slacks with a grey tweed suit jacket, white shirt, and black tie. He looked very handsome. I think that particular combination makes most men look good. As he got ready to head up the other set of steps to leave I put my hand on his upper back and told him to have a good day. Outside near the dumpster I saw two large round flowerpots, probably twenty inches in diameter. One had a large, white Hydrangea in it that didn't have many blooms left on it, which is why someone had set it by the dumpster. The other had some kind of deep rose colored flower in it that was wilted and falling over the edge of the pot. I asked some of the male family members if they would get them and bring them into my home. I wanted to see if I could save them because I thought they were both such pretty flowers and I didn't have any hydrangeas or the other. They thought I was kind of crazy but they did as I asked. Doctor C came back from work and everyone is still in the basement, sitting around tables and other places eating a casual dinner of sub sandwiches that we had made. Doctor C picked up a full length sub, took a couple of bites of it, set it down on a chair and walked away. Seconds later he went back and picked it up. I was standing on a landing half way up the steps that led up to the other room or two. I was leaning against the wall just watching everyone and smiling. Doctor C came up to where I was standing. I turned slightly and leaned my back against the wall. He stood very close to me, facing me. He held his sandwich with one hand and with his right hand turned me slightly so he could put his right arm around my back and pull me closer. We didn't say much, if anything, just stood there slightly smiling at each other. A couple of times, in between bites, he leaned a bit closer and gave me a very quick, light kiss on the lips.","character":"2JKA, 1ISA, 1ISA, 1ISA, 2ANI","emotion":"SD D","text_len":7264,"word_count":1439},{"id":"esther","name":"Esther: an adolescent girl","number":"81","time":"1998","date":"[age 20-21]","gender":"F","age":"TY","text":"Rachel is on the path again and I realize I don't want to take her to the carnival because she won't be able to handle it.

Coming up to the heavy foliage on the bank of the island reminded me of pulling up to the bank of the island in the middle of the lake back in the town where I went to school when I was 10 to 15. We dodged branches, and when the bow of the canoe made landfall, I got out and wondered how I could secure it without a rope. I figured it would be fine, resting on the bank. The friend was skeptical of where we were going. We went uphill through these woods along the ridge in the middle of the island. There was a long log house, but with a modern interior that had new refrigerators and computers. It had screen doors. I went inside. There were many young people milling about doing something that resembled work of some kind, but I failed to see the purpose. They were adversarial toward me, as I was an outsider.  I told them I had permission to be a part of the program. Apparently they were about to move the program somewhere, and I needed to go to the new location, in a nearby city, if I was to be a part of it. They didn't tell me how to get there, but I followed one of them into a secret underground tunnel that led to the other side of the river and the suburban city, like in the nearby resort town, where the new operation was based. It had gray concrete walls and pipes, like the cellar or sewer level of a big building. The light was dim. There was a young woman wearing a tight white knit shirt or sweater toward the middle of the tunnel. She didn't see or hear me. She was doing something with items on a shelf against the wall, partially behind a support column. I knew she would try to keep me from passing through. She reminded me of Nicole, the girl who was over at my apartment the night before. Very fancy girl, with that sorority girl way of talking, but with a very regional tinge to her voice. I snuck up behind her and had a metal rod in my hand -- about the size of a large screwdriver -- for protection. I found it in the tunnel. The tunnel had all sorts of industrial type items like this on shelves. I walked up behind her and told her \"hello.\" She grabbed a razor blade -- a rectangular razor blade, without a handle -- from a shelf in front of her and swiveled toward me. I didn't know how serious she was, so I grabbed her hand holding the razor. I made a threat with the rod, but she didn't seem to care or correctly called my bluff that I wasn't really going to hit her. I instead tried to get the razor from her hand and talk to her. I thought she was attractive, and felt as if her assault may have been her way of flirting. I saw myself coming across as happy go lucky and nonchalant to her utter seriousness. I was afraid she would bend her fingers to cut my hand with the razor, since I only had her by the wrist. She eventually backed off and lowered the razor. She wanted to know where I was going. I told her. She was skeptical. And we walked out of the tunnel, each eyeing each other skeptically, as if one of us could attack. I wasn't going to, but I was afraid she would. I didn't know why she saw me as a threat.","character":"1MKA, 2JSA, 1FSA","emotion":null,"text_len":3577,"word_count":711},{"id":"norms-m","name":"Hall\/VdC Norms: Male","number":"0368","time":"1940s-1950s","date":null,"gender":"M","age":"Y","text":"Double dating with a fraternity brother.

The red, blue (and one other color) Were like flowers, or two-piece flowers.  They were very elegant dresses.  I decided on the red one.  Then, it became a store.  Behind each dress opened up a section of designer-wear following the similar style.  I was a clerk there.  It seemed like the managers of the store were up to something fishy.  They called us to close the store for inventory, or something, right in the middle of good business.  We had to pull in all the displayed clothes back into the 'store' section and close it back into a showroom.  There were a lot of workers.  We were trying to take things back in sections, keeping clothes together, and I wanted to put it in size order, and all facing the same direction.  I was able to do this for a while without getting reprimanded by the managers because there was so much commotion.  My neat-freakish side showing would not be appreciated.

The displays were tall and narrow, and the boxes were like for model trains.  I took a small white sandal down and looked at it, was about to help down there in the shoe department too, though decided I wouldn't like that as much.  A woman holding an upset toddler was approached by a teen carrying the same sandal.  The teen was saying the shoes were not penniless.  The toddler was fighting it and complaining.  The mother told the teen that she wanted him to show her.  He held up the sandal and showed two small round inlets.

He had only fallen into a hedge that was out on the second floor. As my father and I looked over he was pulling out a gun. I ducked and my father was one second short of ducking and ended up getting hit in his right side of his ribs. I picked my father up on my shoulders and carried him throughout the fire station. I was very aggravated because of what had happened so I hid my father in the fire station, got an axe off of the fire truck and went looking for this person.

I had been there once before but I came back now as a guy, under the name 'Robert Knepper'. Some people from Brookland were there. I had math next and I was looking on the map to find where the class was. I couldn't work it out and kept walking back and forwards before realizing where the class was. I also had drama and I was thinking I would go change that later. I got to the class and there was a guy teacher. I said I was new and my name was Robert and he checked on the roll and it said I had been there once before, and then had two days off. There weren't any seats by themselves so I sat at this long desk at the back, but it was around the corner and I couldn't see the board. There were two other new kids and they tried to sit there too. I moved it so I could see, but it was on an angle and no-one else could sit there. I was then watching Prison Break and T-Bag had a son, who was LJ. I was reading something that said T-Bag had lied in prison about having sex with guys in there etc, and that LJ knew he was pretending. Also, Sucre had sacrificed himself and drowned and in a replay or something, I was wondering what they were going to do with Sucre since he was dead. Then some others and I, the others mainly from Prison Break, including Bellick, T-Bag and Eugene, were on the run. We went to this shop, which someone said was Ikea. The place was flooding and it had also flooded. The exhibits were on high platforms, under cover, but the rest of it was low down and outside and that was all flooded, so we could swim over to the platforms. There was a huge aquatic monster under the water which was passed out. We were running to get out. People were also in there after us. We got to the outside and there was a big gate which was locked. There was a fence all the way around it, which had glass on one side of it too. There was a little garden all along the inside of the fence. I found a head of a statue in the garden and started smashing the glass with it, it just left cracks and wouldn't smash. Sucre's cousin was outside as a guard, with the keys. One of the guys with us asked him to unlock it and he refused and I pleaded with him and said there was a monster right behind us and he looked worried and unlocked it. We started running and there was a long stretch of garden before you got the main road and we saw a police car drive past. I said that that was the first time in a long time they haven't stopped for us. Eugene realized The Company was waiting for us (and had made the police stay away from us) and he ran another way and we all followed. We ended up on this huge house block and there were big trees around and a fence around it. Eugene ran out onto this path behind it and some guys with guns chased him. This girl that was with us shot one of the guys through the fence. I reached through the fence and took his phone and gun. His phone was old like and it wasn't in colour (it had that greenish background and the plain black text). I put it in my pocket and asked the girl how to use the gun. She asked what I did know and I said \"I don't know, only what I've seen in the movies\". I pulled the bullet part out and some of the bullets were like rolls of camera film, which meant they'd been used. She went off and I pulled out this roll and it had bullets of different sizes (and they were battery like) in it. This girl was studying a road map of the house to work out how big it was and how many people were likely to be waiting around and the best way to get out. We ended up back at the Ikea and T-Bag told us to wait at this certain point just outside and then he started counting down and then there was a big roar. He had woken up the monster and it reached over the fence (over another side, but we worked out what was going on) and was taking The Company people.","character":"2JSA, 1MOA, 1MKA, 5MPA, 2JSA, 1CZZ, 2JSA","emotion":null,"text_len":3838,"word_count":778},{"id":"izzy-all","name":"Izzy (ALL, including non-consecutive)","number":"1127","time":"2003-2016","date":"2007-03-16 (16)","gender":"F","age":"TY","text":"Ezra and I were wagging.

Bard agreed to this, and fulfilled all requirements, but then it appears there was some misunderstanding, and papa wouldn't or couldn't keep his bargain, forcing Bard to work and save for years before the home was paid for. Glen Freder now comes into the dream, and he and I decide to start out on Sunday on a trip in search of work. We ride bicycles over the dirt roads, which are smooth and not dusty -- evidently there had been rain not long before. The road is rarely level, mostly hilly. On one long hill, I am delayed by a bunch of bicyclists, and Glen takes the paper sack of unpopped corn ahead. Soon I am following him (although he has long since disappeared) rapidly. I come to a farm, evidently belonging to Hemways. There are a good many wagons parked in the barnyard, and a very large manure pile close to barn. I enter the barn and see the sack of popcorn in a feed box, and know that Glen has been here. This corn was brought for \"Fanny\" one of the old horses at Hemways. \"Fanny\" was in a big box stall. Glen had tied her around the neck with a big rope on one end of a large knot. This knot enabled Glen to tie her securely but loosely. She wore a halter. I work away untying the rope and am getting along all right, though I am handicapped by the dim light. Fanny is blind. I am on a sort of balcony 3 or 4 feet above the floor. As I work at the knot I am a little afraid lest she sneeze or cough saliva all over me. I then go out of barn and see a slightly built, dark skinned man (the hired man) digging in ground next to walk and a flower bed with a very large butcher knife. He is trying for fish worms. He is rather surly and does not answer when I ask, \"Are you going fishing?\" I wonder what the hired man would think if he could see the can of worms Glen and I have. Next, I see Glen sitting on a box next to the house. A girl is near him and fondling or stroking him in a playful manner. I feel that we are not especially welcome because of the numerous mouths that Hemways have to feed. Glen is explaining that he is agent for a company which offers a way to make easy money. It is only necessary to get a camera, take pictures, and paste them on to specially decorated sheets, the result being a masterpiece worth considerable money. His company sells a camera designed for this work.

In real life, John Travolta was pregnant with Katie Holmes (like, he was the one that was pregnant). Most of the movie consisted of them on the bed, so the scenes with his belly showing were filmed after he gave birth. The dialogue was really lame. In real life there was a door or something that led to 'Hollywood'. I walked through and Katie Holmes was on a step (it was actually Britney Spears though). I said hi and she didn't say anything. She had a few kids following behind her. There were heaps of people around. I said \"what's up?\" to someone and they (or someone) said \"you seem shy\". I don't remember who, but someone said \"I don't know anything about her, but just got [invited? It's hard to read] to her house\". It was next to the entrance and I thought that Kerr Smith was supposed to live there. Then I saw him walking towards the house. He looked like he did in season 5 of Dawson's Creek. I said \"sup?\" and he gave me a high five. We were friends and had gone on holidays together. Jack, Dawson and Joey (all from Dawson's Creek) were sitting on a bench and there was a space between Dawson and Joey. I said that we (Jack\/Kerr and I) weren't good enough friends for an excited high five. I put my hands up to Dawson and he grinned and did a double high five (crossing our hands over), pretending to be excited. We laughed and I was thinking that his smile was adorable. I sat between he and Joey and he jokingly moved away so I moved towards Joey and then we both moved back at the same time. There was a 'flash' of us sleeping next to each other and we were in the same position. I was then in a car with Mom and Ezra and we were talking about The Beatles and I said that I was sick of them now (from playing Rock Band). A song was playing on the radio that I didn't know and then Even the Nights Are Better was on. Mom wanted to go to Mexico to do something to do the car and we were going to drive there. I said I didn't want to go because it was a really long drive, saying \"it takes like 10 hours to get to America\".

The ring was not a full circle - it was adjustable. I put it on the ring finger of my left hand. I took it off a time or two and put it back on. He was sitting across from me, maybe at a table. I put my left hand on top of my right hand, somewhat outstretched in front of me. My hands were tan. I checked my nails to see what kind of shape my manicure was in. They looked fine.

She is attracted to me, but may not want to have a sexual encounter with me because I do that in my dreams. The woman has blond hair and her name is Lucy. She is talkative and kind of annoying. She reminds me of my classmate Rachel Thompson. I sit up to talk. I make an attempt to be social and go through the courting process, though I am not comfortable doing so. We're outside a bar.

My car was sliding all over the road and besides that, I was lost. I was trying to get to a school, or maybe a theater where I supposed to be at rehearsal. It turns out that my destination was in Smithtown. I was with someone and we were now riding bicycles. Because I was late I decided to go really fast on my bike and up this ramp which turned out to be a glass roof. I crashed through the roof amongst a crowd of people lying on the floor. It was quiet in the room. I landed and just sat where I was. I couldn't help but giggle. I looked around me and the other people were laughing too. BUT then I looked behind me and there was Sean lying on the floor. He looked disgusting. One of his arms was chopped off, his other arm was dangling, his legs were mangled and his skin was burnt (it looked sort of like day old, dry, overcooked chickenskin). His face was even like that. As soon as I saw him the tone of the room changed. I realized that it was me who had done this to Sean with my bicycle. He kept yelling, \"Why why why did you do this to me you bitch?!\" He was rushed to the hospital and so was I. I was afraid that he would try to kill me so I escaped from my room and ended up in Meg Ryan's room. She was a psycho but I convinced her to let me stay. She had a room from which I see all over the hospital. Sean had a complete make over and was now this ugly terminator type guy. He had patches of skin stretched across his face to cover his old face. Looking out the window, I could see him walking around. I knew he was looking for me. It turned into this tense chase scene. He was always on my tail. At one point, we were both on the roof with Meg Ryan, and I escaped through some sort of laundry basket. For some reason, I feel as though this creature (because I couldn't tell who it was after awhile) was really gentle.

Some people took our cat Nina and used her in a play across the street from where I was.  But when she came on stage, she had a rope tied to her back leg, and she was meowing to be freed.  I was appalled.  At the end, she then appeared on the roof of the building to my left.  How she got there I don't know.  She leapt across to the building on my right.  She got stuck and hung dangerously over the edge.  She managed in this to free herself.  She got down off the roof and started to walk away.  I ran forward and picked her up.  She didn't like it, but I talked to her.  Told her I was sorry, sent her home to hide under my bed.  I knew she understood.  I turned and went back to help at 'my parents'' ice cream store.  I met a few people on the way.  I was going to re-open the store after the performance when a younger girl came out of the neighboring store.  She had curly sandy brown hair and freckles.  She introduced herself as what sounded like \"Shirlotte Kearnsy\"  so I wondered a moment if her name was really Shirley or Charlotte.  I decided it was Charlotte.  She told me she wasn't actually new in town- that explained why she looked familiar.  She was quite a bit younger than I, but I liked her and had a good feeling about our friendship.  Later on, I went to get my pen and pad.  I saw Charlotte and her father, Bob MacKenzie.  He was yelling at her and was insanely mad about something, trying to force her inside.  She wriggled free and I told her to run.  We went and hid in my parents' store.  There was an entryway with crackers and I asked if she wanted some ice cream.  On the door she saw a picture of my boyfriend Jeremy and me.  She saw how happy I looked and exclaimed we must be married and have a ton of kids.  Her small-town country girl thought process was evident in what she said.  I looked at the door and it saw in the picture her and me, not Jeremy and me.  But I told her no, he was my boyfriend and we're very much in love, that people with that many kids lose love.  We laughed.  My \"mother\" was at the counter.  We didn't get the ice cream, though.  Somehow, we found out that the mayor of the town had an affair with someone's husband.  Later at a dinner it somehow came out.  The mayor confessed to her husband, but the man she cheated with looked cold and spiteful- probably proud of what he'd done.","character":"2JSA, 1ANI, 1FSA, 1MKA, 1FKA, 1MKA","emotion":"SD D, AN 1FKA, HA 1FKA","text_len":2417,"word_count":471},{"id":"kenneth","name":"Kenneth","number":"0102","time":"1996-1998","date":"03\/05\/1996","gender":"M","age":"Y","text":"<i>Apple Juice Jugs<\/i> <br\/><br\/> Someone is paying $5.00 per pound for one-gallon plastic jugs that had apple juice in them.","character":"1ISA","emotion":null,"text_len":126,"word_count":20},{"id":"arlie","name":"Arlie: a middle-aged woman","number":"37","time":"1992-1998","date":"1\/2\/95","gender":"F","age":"A","text":"I go to visit a former neighbor woman and enter by the side door and walk in on a male guest who is in the bath tub and a boy in the bathroom.

I decide to attend some classes since the school year is almost over, and nothing can happen to me for not turning in homework assignments since it's not really my school. I see the classes posted on an electronic board, but I don't know the period with which we're starting. Soon I'm in a section of the school which I've never seen before in waking life, but I think I've seen it at least once before in a dream. There are a lot of stairs going down, and suddenly there is a discontinuity in the stairs for about 10 vertical feet, and below there are more stairs. I don't remember trying to \"jump\" down to the other set of stairs in this dream, but I think I might have jumped in another dream. Now I am in a room, which looks somewhat like it could be either the library or the art room. They are taking pictures of two people at a time, for some reason. I think it has something to do with a project we are doing. I think I'm trying to dance, and then I move over to the other side of the room to dance. Barry and Stephanie are dancing to some different type of music. They tell me what it's called (and I don't remember the name), but it sounds to me like some really fast moving heavy metal. I start dancing with Stephanie and I realize how fun dancing to this type of music is. I think she's surprised that I'm actually dancing to it, but I don't remember exactly what I think she's thinking at the time. Then, she goes out into the hallway, and there is a bed down at the end. I don't remember if she's angry at me, or what was going on, but I see her under the sheets and ask her if I can take them off. She said I could, so I pulled them off her face. I complimented her until she got up, and I think started crying. She walks over to the nearest room, tells (the teacher?) that she's sorry for everything she might have done (over the course of forever?). I think I've done something to allow her to change, and I feel good for that reason. Now I'm in another room where people are bouncing on this (air or water filled?) wrestling ring type of thing. I'm inside, and when Louise comes in I'm disappointed (although she looks more \"innocent\" than she usually does- maybe she looks like someone else I know). I get out, and the next thing I remember is seeing Riley I try to be funny, but nobody seems to think what I'm saying is funny. He makes a certain comment, and I run into a small food store, thinking it's appropriate humor based on what he just said, but nobody's laughing. I see a big, chocolate cupcake (which in the dream I call a \"muffin\"), and I want to buy it. I have some money in my pocket and I ask how much it costs. The lady says somewhere between $3 and $4, and since I have a $5 bill I give it to her. I'm surprised it costs under $5. I also remember Mr. Pons trying to rush a bunch of us into a bus, and I remember not having my bag and wanting to look for it. I I rush back into the school to try to get it in time to catch the bus. I don't remember if I ever found my bag, but I did forget to go back to the bus.","character":"1FKA, 1MKA, 1FKA","emotion":"CO 1FKA, HA D, SD 1FKA, HA D","text_len":3141,"word_count":626},{"id":"bea2","name":"Bea 2: a college student","number":"059","time":"2007-2010","date":"03\/18\/2010","gender":"F","age":"Y","text":"The first part of my dream that I remember took place in an old classroom where I might have had 3rd or 4th grade. Sue and I were there with my college baseball team. The coaches and athletic directors had chosen us as managers of the team, so we were there at their first meeting. The meeting started ordinarily enough; the coach gave some inspirational speech, but then the talk devolved to girls. I distinctly remember Keegan being there and looking absolutely perfect. I whispered something to Sue about him being the captain. Martin and Trenton were there too. All of a sudden, the power went out. Sue and I scrambled out of the room to the parking lot. First we stopped at a cafe outside the classroom and we ordered caramel macchiato. When I turned around, Keegan was there. I lamented that I couldn't remember where I had parked my car and asked him if he would please help me find it. He agreed; I purposely led him in the opposite direction of where I knew my car to be so that we could spend more time together. I must have looked cold because he took off his sport coat and draped it over my shoulders. We went on walking through this rainy forest until we found my car. We had been joking about cars and baseball and clothes, and the conversation seemed so real, the banter, the flirting...I'm amazed it was only a dream. Keegan opened my car door and threw some of his stuff in. I was sad when he started walking away, but then he looked back at me and said, \"You're not driving off yet, are you? Come walk with me some more!\" Delighted, I followed him down some ravine covered in ferns and we went on chatting and laughing. Next, I was part of some secret organization on campus that was trying to change the housing lottery system. We met in this secret cave off campus that no one could find unless he or she knew about it beforehand. There were about 30 of us and we had these secret files on CDs that we were trying to erase. Drake burst in the door and demanded that we hand over the CDs. I had them in my hand. Everyone yelled at me not to give them to him, but to just throw them in the fire. I looked hesitant, so someone grabbed them from me and threw them in the fire to destroy them. I immediately ran over and yanked them from the flames and gave them to Drake. He looked at me as if he were going to hit me and ran out. Everyone started yelling at me for giving them over. \"You don't understand!\" I yelled. \"You will forgive me, but Drake may not.\" A few days must have gone by, and I was manicuring the lawn outside my house --literally manicuring it with a nail file. I was upset because Drake hadn't yet called me. I thought I should just give in and call him, but I didn't want to. Just then Mommy was mad at me, but I think Martin didn't know I had given away any secret information. He offered me some of his pasta and I took a bite. Later in my dream I was eating breakfast with Trenton at Pickering.

I was sitting next to Judy D watching TV with her and her husband. She was to my left. At some point I had turned my back to her and had nearly fallen asleep. I had the feeling that she didn't really want me to spend the night. When she thought I might be falling asleep she started saying my name and I just pretended to be asleep. She moved away from me very slowly so as not to wake me up. It seems that she had decided she would be okay with me staying there as long as I was only sleeping on the sofa. Now Suzanne B and one of our other CRHP sisters are there. We were chatting and tending to two infants. I was holding one of them on its stomach while rocking her. The women were looking at me kind of odd and I asked them why. They did not think what I was doing was good for the baby and they didn't think the baby like it at all. I thought about defending myself and telling them that I've known babies to find this very comforting and that it can help them to go to sleep. I decided against it and just handed the baby to one of the other women. I said something to the effect that it looked like no one else was going to show up. I was really tired and really just wanted to sleep but knew that would be rude with the other two women there so I told them that I was going to head home. One of them protested ever so slightly but I said I would be fine. I went outside to get on my bike. My bike looked like a section of split rail fence. It had a post on either end and three connecting rails, one at the bottom, one at the top, and one in the middle. There was no seat, no handlebars, no wheels, and no pedals. I don't know what actually propelled it forward, but when I first started out I was having trouble getting it to move. Because it was so late, it was quite dark outside. I felt a little anxious about this but quickly dismissed it. As I was riding home my bike started talking to me. It was affirming all of the things that I had done \"right\" that day. I wasn't buying all of it, but nonetheless found it a little comforting. I'm not sure why, but I got lost going home. I came to a housing subdivision. I thought I knew a way through this subdivision to get home. I rode through a section that reminded me of the inside of a home. I was getting so tired. I saw something that reminds me of a bus shelter. The weather wasn't that bad, chilly but not freezing cold and no precipitation, so I decided that I would just go in there and sleep for a few hours before going the rest of the way home. I was just settling onto the floor when a woman approached me looking both scared and angry. As she got closer she asked me what I was doing. I told her. She started yelling at me that I was in her home. I quickly realized that I had ridden my bike through her house. I apologized profusely. As I got on my bike I asked her if she could give me directions. I explained where I lived and what the buildings looked like. They looked like the condos on the right side of North Point Bay, with brown, rustic-looking siding. She was pointing as she gave me directions. As she pointed I saw a huge waterfall that reminds me of Niagara Falls. I realized that if I had continued riding in the dark earlier I would have gone right into the waterfall as I didn't know it was there and it was very close to the street that I needed to take to get home. I was thinking how lucky I was that I stopped here. The woman seemed to not be angry with me any longer. I got on my bike and headed home.","character":"1FKA, 1MKA, 1FKA, 2FSC, 1FSC, 1FSA","emotion":"AP D","text_len":3673,"word_count":743},{"id":"college-f","name":"College students, 1997-1998 (F)","number":"029-3","time":"1997-1998","date":null,"gender":"F","age":"Y","text":"This dream deals with me babysitting a 14-year-old with my next door neighbor.

They live in a room down this hall here. We knock, and go in. He's sitting on the bed - looks like Rob Lowe - she's sitting (on the floor?) at the end and there's at least one other visitor. We all chat happily for a bit - I think the older ones leave. By the way, she looks like Demi Moore - they're a fine match. During some event like fetching something from under the bed or bookcase where it fell, Rob pulls out a nasty-looking reptile hanging on by his pointy teeth to a paper or book. He's a lot like the \"monster-sticks\" in Labyrinth they were biting Ludo with. Pinkish, big head, little legs, vicious. He gets it up on the bed, but nobody knows what to do with it. You certainly don't want to pick it up. He's poking at it a bit, though, and I don't think it's funny at all. He might get bitten. Somehow it gets closer to me. I think he knocks or flips it and it ends up near me and I'm nearly panicking. I try to back away and say things like \"Help me! Get it away from me!\" and there's some confusion and when I look round again everybody's gone. Somehow I do get bitten by the thing, and it hurts, There's something thrashing around and a bit of calling for help and somebody does come, and it gets off me. I don't know what happened to it. It's not visible, but I don't know if somebody took it away, or it ran away. There's somebody with me, I'm gasping, looking around, paranoid, hoping there's not more. <br \/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; I've got a splinter in my hand from thrashing around, which I'd thought for a minute was a bite or a sting, maybe poisonous. I see what it is now and pull it out. It's actually very large and sticking out. Funny. At some point I am reading an entertainment guide, or some such thing. (I think this is after the above.) And I find that Pete Townsend's going to be in town soon. I am real excited about this, and then when I look it over and see that it's better than that (he's doing a musical, for about a week!) I'm even more thrilled. I think maybe there's a chance I could meet him - but it's not that long away. It's very unusual that he'd be doing a show like that, it will be quite interesting to see how it turns out. He's probably doing it for the novelty, to see what it's like.","character":"2JSA, 2JKA, 1MKA, 2JSA, 1FKA, 1MKA, 1FKA, 1MKA","emotion":"HA 2JKA+D","text_len":3710,"word_count":707},{"id":"b","name":"Barb Sanders","number":"3026","time":"1960-1997","date":"1996-09-30","gender":"F","age":"YA","text":"I am traveling down into the earth somehow. There are dangerous paths I must tread. Then one section would end at a white wall. I'd look for the beginning of the next segment. I look up at the ceiling and see a pull string. I pull it down and a small hatch hole appears with a pull down ladder which looks and sounds like a wooden toy with slats of wood on a string that cascade down into a different configuration. These slats then create a ladder. I walk up, pulling myself up the ladder. Now I am in a dangerous part where there are poisonous jungle snakes. I pull out a large knife. I see black shiny snakes coming out from under cups and dishes and statues on a shelf. I have to climb up on that shelf to go to the next level. A center statue is in the way and I decide I don't want that one anyway and choose another and then another. Someone says or I think, \"Do they need an Elvis statue to get on with it?\" Six snakes come out and I chop off their heads simultaneously. They are very beautiful with vibrant colors, turquoise and so on. Now I get to the next section. Each section is different. This one has people who are very aggressive and belligerent. I must out-bluster them to survive. I do so, easily. I have arrived. Now it is time to go back. I hold a sleeping bag-like thing and am zipping up the end, while it is still rolled up, making a spiral path for the zipper. Somehow this means I've discovered a faster, safer way through without taking those dangerous paths. But now a very noisy, aggressive boy whirls toward me. He wants my attention. He wants to go with me. A woman chuckles and said she found him at the site (setting) called Cathedral and his name is Daniel O'Flannery. We laugh at the irony of an obvious Irish Catholic boy being from a setting called the Cathedral. The boy has red hair and freckles and is cute and wholesome-looking. I tell him to leave me alone. His demanding, attention-getting behavior won't work with me. I then decide to go back through the paths. He follows me. I at first am concerned he'll be harmed, but then he asked for it. I warned him. So I decide this will be a lesson for him and go on, being aggressive and belligerent to the dangerous people on this path, in order to safely get through. I realize from his distant yelling he's scared and will get hurt. I call down the spiral to him, \"Just be your fierce, aggressive self on this section. It will work for you.\" He does it and catches up to me. I turn to him and say, \"This next section is the opposite. You have to be clever and quiet.\" He tries to do so.

We were just chatting and catching up and were laughing a lot. As more people began showing up we were looking for the other leafs of the table to add in so we could all sit around one table. We thought that everyone who would show up would fit around this one table. We thought that would be really nice to be able to do that. We all started getting up and pulling the table apart. We decided to pull it into another room so we would have room to expand it more. Then we decided to take some of the two-person square tables and put them at the end of this oval table and just keep making it longer and longer by adding those. So we started moving those in. Some of them were a bit taller than others so we tried to keep all those together at the end. As we were putting the square ones next to the oval ones, I was talking to someone and Jake G. We were talking about our little radio or TV program that we had done together. I said something about something that he had messed up. He admitted it. We were kind of laughing about it. I couldn't remember exactly what it was. I said, well, I did too. It wasn't anything critical, just nice memories. I was standing there looking at him thinking that he was as attractive now as ever, except that he was much nicer now. I was looking for a place to sit and I didn't want to sit next to Darren again as I was before we moved the table. It looked like there weren't any seats left. As I was walking around the table looking for a spot to sit, and I wanted to sit next to someone I knew fairly well, I walked behind Susan J and I rubbed her back. I was going to say something and my eyes started tearing. I though dang it, I don't want to cry. This is ridiculous. She looked at me and said what? I said, I wanted to say something but my eyes started tearing up. Several people started laughing. I sat on a ledge behind them. I said, I'm just like my dad. I was kind of joking but I started crying a little bit too. Then I just started laughing uncontrollably. I hid my face trying to compose myself.

She asked me something of the timing of a 7-course meal and it being 8 o'clock.  She was extremely happy and wanted to treat Jeremy and I to it for being the first customers.  This of course made me nervous.  Then she told me the rules to our stay.  No chocolate.  I don't remember the other two rules.  At some point she found out I was vegetarian and took that into account in her cooking.  What she ended up bringing me was a sort of vegetarian stew.  It was very good.  I tempted her to try some.  She picked out a lot of broccoli.  She spit some of it back- she didn't like it.  Then we were in the forest.  Going down from one place, there were pictures on the wall.  I was told one of them was worth quite a bit if we could pick it out.  We couldn't choose our own speed of descent, however.  So we took the next path.  There were several groups and what looked like three trails.  We passed one group with my friend Neil Block and his father Jerry.  We went up one trail, and it lead back around to the main.  Rejoining the group, I led the way to the third trail.  I ended up behind, though.  When I went to catch up, I ran through some weeds that whipped my legs.  I made some comment, and the guide laughed at me and told me I was supposed to have jumped over.  Hard to do when you can't see.  I took some of the weeds and whipped her legs, and asked her if it was so funny while her own legs were bloody.  Someone else had blood all over the bottoms of their shoes. <br \/><br \/>  We went up and were walking on a platform.  I saw a 'sheepcat'- it had some of the fluffy curly hair on the sides.  As we passed a treetop, it leapt at me and bit my hand, and was hanging there.  It was a kitten, not like I'd thought before.  A rather vicious one.  I managed to fling the cat off, and it landed a ways in front of us.   A dog ran past and attacked the cat.  When I got over there the cat was amazingly still alive.  It bit me again and I flung it off.  It fell down over the railing about 50 feet, with a thud, onto its side.  The dog came to attack me, then.  It was heavy, but I managed to fling it also over the railing.  He landed harder, right next to the cat.  While the cat had attacked me, I still yelled at it and told it to run, shake off the shock before the dog got to it.","character":"1MKA, 1FSA, 2JSA, 1MOA, 1ISA, 1ISA, 1ANI","emotion":"AP D, HA 1MKA","text_len":2685,"word_count":537},{"id":"izzy-all","name":"Izzy (ALL, including non-consecutive)","number":"4204","time":"2003-2016","date":"2015-12-02 (24)","gender":"F","age":"TY","text":"I was parked at the office which looked similar, but was more cottage-like and in a different location.

[laugh] Mom was fixing supper and it was going to be on any minute, but I had to do it, so I put this sign on my door, \"Do not enter, surprise things.\" And I tested out the keyboard again with the fresh set of batteries Mom gave me, and lo and behold, it worked beautifully. And I set it up on the stool, the black stool, since my desk was taken over by the task ____ board, and I don't remember too much of what my session was like, but I do remember feeling really, really good that it was resurrected again. Of course, when I woke up, I realized it was only a dream, and I was like, \"Oh man!\" But this is one of these dreams that really gives you a good feeling when you wake up, just all around. The rides were fun, everything was fun, and it feels like [sings a little song] \"______ in the song I sing today. You're in my dreams at night, and when I rise, there's a ______ of my slumber. You're never out of thought.\" The best I could sing at 4:30 in the morning.

He had gotten a call from a patient who was insisting he do surgery and Doctor Pf said he wasn't a surgeon and he didn't agree with the decision to have the surgery anyway. But he said if he was going to do the surgery he had to have someone assisting him. The surgery was going to be on a little boy and the mother was being very adamant because without surgery the child could die. So I had called Doctor C to see if he would do it. It was 4:30 am when I called and he was very pleasant to talk to for that time of morning and for receiving a call at home. He said no problem. He found out from me who the patient was and where to go and then said he would be there. Later I drove to his house and I was going to spend the night there, but it was later that morning. I got there just as he was getting ready to leave. We chatted very briefly and then he kissed me on the lips and left. I was quite surprised by that, that he did that. I stayed at the house while he left to go do this surgery. I heard Sara C coming so I grabbed a blanket and lay down on the floor behind the sofa and pretended to be asleep. The sofa didn't sit next to a wall. She knelt on the sofa and looked over and saw me lying there. She said something to me and I pretended to be half-asleep. I said I was laying here reading and I fell asleep so I just stayed here. She insisted that I get up and lay on the sofa. She was on her way out. I watched her leave and was thinking that Sara C just didn't seem like the type of woman Doctor C would be married to. They appeared to be an odd couple. Although, Sara C in the dream did not look at all like Sara C in waking life. After Sara C left the boys came down, they were maybe 5-7 years younger than in waking life. It was Jeff C and Ben C although Ben C said that was not his name. I don't remember now what he said it was. It was about time for me to get up already and I had just gotten to sleep. The boys stayed there and wanted to talk and play. So I did. I talked to them and gave them a lot of attention. I realized then that I had to get ready and get to work. I had seen a shower on wheels at the bottom of the driveway. I went out and pushed it to the top of the driveway and it rolled off the edge of the driveway and into the grass. I thought that was probably too far so I pulled it back out of the grass. I was trying to figure out a way to use it so no one would see me naked. It looked like a bathtub with two walls on the ends but nothing on either side. The walls on the ends were not very wide and got narrower towards the top. I realized if I turned it one way the neighbors would see me and if I turned it the other way the cars driving by would see me. I realized that I didn't bring my shampoo and stuff with me so I was going to go back in the house to get it. At that point I saw the shower wasn't even in Doctor C's driveway but in someone else's. So I walked back into the house and I asked someone which shower I should use. They said they didn't have a shower in the house. They said there was supposed to be one in one room but Doctor C made it into his poolroom and so there wasn't one in there I could use. I really wanted to take a shower and get cleaned up before I went to work. I asked someone if I could see the house. There were quite a few people around and they weren't sure if they should let me see the house. I said I was sure it was okay because I worked for Doctor C and he and I had a very good relationship and he had invited me to see the house previously and I hadn't been able to make it. They finally agreed. This house was just incredible. Much of it had an almost sci-fi appearance to it. Contemporary! Cool! Unusual! Yet some rooms were fairly traditional. There is no way I can come close to describing this accurately. The office was fairly traditional. Very large room with lots of dark wood. Very masculine in appearance. Then we started to go into this other room. It was as if the walls had different levels to them, almost like upside down stair steps. But they kept moving. As you tried to enter an area the wall would come down and block you. I tried to get down and crawl under but didn't make it that way either. Someone said you had to push a button to stop them so you could get in. This was Doctor C's own private room and he did that so that other people couldn't get in. I finally found one of the buttons and pushed it and then saw a red door. So I held the button while I got as close to the door as I could and then made a dash for the door. I got through. I don't even remember now what was in this room. We were going from one room to another and we had to get in this monorail type of transport. The house looked like it was a city block in size and it seemed to be located in an area similar to Las Vegas. A lot of neon lights. As we were riding we were outdoors and I could see his house was hidden by lots of trees and greenery. We were going up to the 7th floor and there was a section of wall that was octagon shaped. On each section of the octagon was an elevator door and the octagon was going around in a circle. So you had to try to push the button while it was going around. I finally did. Several of the other people got in the elevator and I couldn't get in quick enough, so myself and another person got in another one that opened. Someone said room 7 to get the elevator to take us where we wanted to go instead of pushing a button on the inside. The elevator itself was shaped kind of like a space module that astronauts return to earth in. And it didn't go up and down but it went sideways and at angles. At another point we were in, maybe his playroom. He was there and not dressed at all like he would normally dress. He kissed me again and this time it was more passionate. He started to pull my blouse up and I stopped him and said no we can't do that. Things still progressed a bit. We did end up making love. Then all of a sudden I wasn't with him again and we were looking at some other rooms in the house. The ninth floor I believe. There was a big open area of marble floor and marble steps, green I think. It was a huge area and I thought this is just such a huge house. The steps here were a half circle, very wide, and fairly tall. I thought, no wonder it takes him so long to answer the door or to go from one room to another. I remember going up the steps but I don't remember where they led. There was another place in the house similar to that. I was spending time with his boys and we were playing and laughing and having a good time. They were really enjoying being with me and the attention. It was time for me to go and I wanted to hurry and leave before Doctor C saw me. So the boys were trying to help me get my things together and out to the car. As I was almost at the car, Doctor C came out.","character":"1MOA, 1FSC, 1MKA, 1FKA, 2MKA","emotion":"CO D","text_len":6881,"word_count":1424},{"id":"elizabeth","name":"Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s","number":"0601","time":"1999-","date":"2003-07-06","gender":"F","age":"A","text":"Part of this was me trying to explain to someone that I needed a cool-air humidifier for my throat and that all I have is a hot-air humidifier.

I'm not sure why. I was standing in the front foyer of their home. There was a doorway into the kitchen to my right and a doorway into another room in front of me. They are both standing at a kitchen counter facing me, with Denis K standing nearest to me, to the left of Rosalie K. We're talking and I said something to Denis K about teaching at MC. He responded and then laughed with his usual robust laugh. I saw that Jennifer K and her family were there. I had mixed feelings about this but decided it would give us an opportunity to talk more casually since there were plenty of other people around. The piece of furniture I had brought them was about the same height and width as my bedside table but only about half as deep. It had visible legs on the bottom. It almost looks like a bookshelf. It's not in very good shape. I carry it to the back of their house. They have a patio that is the full length of their house. In the dream their house is much longer than in waking life and the patio has an awning over the entire thing. The patio was full of furniture that they intended to refinish. There were six more pieces that they had stripped but not done anything more with. When I saw that I felt better that someone else does the same thing that I do, having started refinishing three different pieces but not having finished any of them. Someone else brought a couple of pieces of furniture up and sat them down near where I was talking with Rosalie K. I told her that she has the coolest things. She told me I was welcome to take one of the pieces that were just placed near us. I walked closer to look at them and realized it was five different chairs. I was disappointed but I didn't want her to know that. I didn't really like any of them but I felt that I had to choose one because her offer was based on what I said. They were sitting very close together so I couldn't get a very good look at any of them so I pulled them apart so I could see each one well. Three of them I ruled out immediately as not being ones I would take. One of them was a straight back chair and told her it was kind of interesting. The seat was round and the back was oval shaped. It was upholstered with a fabric that looked like needlepoint. I really didn't like it either but I was trying to think of something positive to say. I told her that I need a straight back chair for reading because it is best for my back. The fifth one was a very odd shape, kind of like a half of an empty egg shell, lengthwise half. I sat down in it to try it. You could lean back in it, but it went back way too far for my comfort. I was afraid I was going to fall over backwards. I really didn't want that one either and I also didn't want to take one just because she had offered me one, yet I didn't want to give her the wrong impression. It would seem very odd that I said what I did when they were set down there but now didn't want one when she offered it to me. Maybe it was a matter of credibility. Fortunately, someone walked up and started talking to us so I was off the hook. We were discussing the furniture that they had there. They were saying that they needed to get rid of some of it, or organize or clean up the patio. I'm just not sure. I am down in the basement with Rosalie K, walking along the back wall that would run parallel to and along the patio. She said something about needing to get rid of something along that wall but that they hadn't done it because they knew it was going to be a major project. I made the comment that maybe it wouldn't be as bad as they think. She didn't seem to like that I said that. The look on her face made me wonder if she thought I was insinuating that she didn't know what she was talking about. I must have told her that I would help her with it because we start taking things off the wall or moving things. It appears to be a very old, very large, copper store built into the wall and surrounded by brick on the inside of the wall. The brick goes all the way to the ceiling. It is maybe a 5 foot square. The stove top comes just above my waist. We started by moving some things along the ceiling. It didn't take us long to do this. Now the stove is no longer surrounded by brick - it's as though the brick was never there. There is also no wall behind the stove, separating it from the outdoors. I told her that now all she needs is to get a couple of men with a two-wheeler to just wheel it out. Even though this was true, Rosalie K seemed irritated by this, as though it bothered her for me to be right. We're standing on the patio again and talking about the furniture. I realize that I'm not going to have a chance to talk to Jennifer K at all because it was time for me to leave. I told them that I needed to go. Just as I did, someone, maybe Jennifer K , pointed to a piece of furniture and asked if that was the piece that I had wanted - a piece they had agreed to give to me some time ago. I looked and recognized it though it looked pretty different. I remembered that when I saw it the last time it looked somewhat like two buffet pieces, one sitting on top of the other. It also had a row of decorative spindles across the front. The lower piece had a lot of drawers but several of the drawers were missing. Now it was just the lower piece and the spindles were all missing. I wondered if Daddy or Brian F might be able to make new drawers for me. I didn't really know that I wanted it anymore - not the way it was. Without the other pieces it had lost its uniqueness and charm. I think they must have realized all of these pieces were gone because several of them started looking for the pieces among the piles of furniture and stuff on the patio. I recall seeing someone climbing on things to look for the missing pieces. It also looked as though they had stripped it. Maybe they had forgotten they had told me that I could have it and that I was going to refinish it. That didn't really bother me that they had stripped it already. I just felt awkward about the whole thing. As they are looking for the pieces, I realize that I'm not going to be able to take it home with me anyway because it won't fit in my car. I'll have to find someone with a truck and ask them to come and help me.","character":"1FKA, 1MKA, 1FKA, 2JSA, 1ISA","emotion":"SD D, HA D","text_len":6310,"word_count":1259},{"id":"merri","name":"Merri: an artist","number":"022","time":"1999-2000","date":"06\/02\/1999","gender":"F","age":"A","text":"I saw empty rooms on my floor. #1446 or #1456, but then it might have been #1256. The rooms were empty and so big and I was given such a tiny room. I decided to do something about it. I decided I would either talk out loud to Roseanne or type a letter. Then I got on my bicycle and I forgot about it. I was riding down the outside edge of the railroad track cross ties. On the other side was a subway train. I was in between the train tracks and the subway tracks and trains were coming in both directions. I could feel and hear the bike going, \"ba-bump ba-bump\" on the train tracks. The mechanic was projecting gears onto the sky and the metal was metal-colored and shiny. The gears moved in the sky. Miller Lee, who'd signed many contracts and screwed them all up said that last week's projection was upsetting to him. The American flag was projected into the sky with a banana stuck on top of the flagpole. I didn't know why that would upset him when he was so mean. The mechanic was working just south of the train station. The case worker's assessment said that I had accuracy problems and did not notice boundaries and to compensate with maximum efficiency they would give me the smallest room because I was least likely of all people to notice. I knew they were wrong and the opposite was true but I had a bicycle to ride and could not dwell on this topic so long. One empty room's view had a view of a university in the shade. I rode my bike and I stood against the fence in Grandfather Anderson's driveway. Their house was empty. After a while a girl, Gina, with red tattoo of a little girl on her arm (Gina was only about 12 herself) rode up and put her bike in the garage. She walked like she knew where she was going. I asked her, \"Do you live on the 14th floor?\" She said, \"No, I have been living here for the past 3 months. My father lives here too, but he's never here.\" \"What are you doing?\" I asked her, and she said, \"I'm writing a business plan for Mr. Anderson.\" I knew she meant Grandfather Anderson and not my father. my father was not so interested in business. I said, \"We live right down the hill through the woods or by the road if you go down the hill turn left and the second house on the right; if you need help.\" I was angry Grandfather didn't ask Rudy to write it and didn't ask me if I needed a bigger place to stay.","character":"1FKA, 1MOA, 1MKA, 1FKA, 1MKA, 1MKA","emotion":"AN 1FKA","text_len":2348,"word_count":457},{"id":"emma","name":"Emma: 48 years of dreams","number":"1964-008","time":"1949-1997","date":"5\/64","gender":"F","age":"A","text":"Fragment: Father Andrew's chair = throne; on each side three empty chairs.

I would get one back out, but then another would come in. There were three black ones. I went inside and locked up and then saw Tigger swimming in the pool. I unlocked it and ran to her, but I couldn't grab her and I accidentally pushed her under. I tried to dive in, but I couldn't (I was like, floating upside down), so I swam under and she was at the bottom. I grabbed her and pushed her out the top. I got out and the pool tasted like Vital Green and I had some yellow sliver of slime on my leg. I put her inside and Ezra came and gave her a pat. I realized I was thirsty (I was in real life too) and got a drink. I noticed I had some dreams on the bench, so I grabbed them. There was an old envelope of mine and I opened it and there was a brand new, crispy $50 note in it. Dad mentioned a new Keanu Reeves movie called \"Klaatu\" coming out and I said \"Klaatu barada nikto, I've seen the original, I'm not interested in the remake\". I went to my laptop and I had a weird movie playing. The USB was plugged in and had random stuff on it. I had a 4.5gb ISO with Crash Palace on it. I didn't know what it was at first, but I played it and realized and was pretty excited about it. I decided to finish watching The English Patient. Then I decided to go to the shop. I walked there and only brought my water. I was wearing a tight-ish girl like shirt that was almost navy blue. I was near some girls in the shop and these other people came and they owned some alternative clothes shop, with clothes that no-one would wear and there were quite a few scattered throughout the shop, and dissed our clothes. I was walking down the same way they were and they said to be that \"it must be embarrassing walking around wearing that\" and I shouted \"it must be embarrassing walking around with that face!\". I walked back and went into this shop. It had a small entrance and this old lady was going in too, so I stopped and let her go first. When you first got in, there was a shelf full of DVD's. There were DVD's for Thank God You're Here and they had Shaun Micallef on the front, which I thought was odd since he was a guest star. There were DVD's for Lost, but they were in CD cases and the covers were boring. They had strips, the top one had Locke and the rest had the episode titles. There were four episodes per one. Point Break and another Keanu Reeves movie were on the shelf. There were a few other movies which I had decided to download last night. Across from that, were the video games. I was looking at them. This lady was following me around, watching. I had gotten a pack of little Easter eggs and was eating them. I had a plastic bag, that I was keeping them in. I realized I had forgotten my wallet and my phone. This business like lady was next to me, and I thought she was a vampire. She had dark red lipstick on and a black bag. I was going to ask her if I could use her phone but I decided not to. I asked the lady who was following me, since she worked there and told her I'd forgotten my phone and wallet. She brought me to a counter. They went on the computer and asked for my \"Netpay\" number. I said I didn't know what they were talking about, although I assumed it was something you get when you have a job, are over 18 etc. They said they had to make sure I could pay for the call. I saw the prices for some of them and it said \"1 x 9.05\" ($9.05 for one minute) and it was like $400 for a 30 minute call. I told them again I didn't know what they were talking about and that I'd just finished year 12 and was going to the Technical College\/university next year (and therefore wasn't working or over 18). I got really upset saying that I only needed to call Mom so she can bring money because I ate one of the Easter eggs, which I ate because \"I haven't had chocolate for ages\". They said that they wouldn't let me go until I paid and I started shouting saying I needed to call Mom to be able to pay and that I just wanted to go home and finish watching \"a movie with Ralph Fiennes\". A bus pulled up full of old women, and Mom came in after them. She was wearing makeup and looked really gross. She came in and was sorting it out. I went to take the eggs out of the bag but it fell apart and they went everywhere. They said not to worry and I grabbed my water bottle from the counter. I was crying and said that \"I'm never coming here again!\" and I was thinking that I was never going to go the shop on my own again either. I woke up with tears in my eyes too.","character":"2ANI, 1FKA, 1MKA, 2FSA, 1MKA, 1FSA","emotion":null,"text_len":4542,"word_count":913},{"id":"pegasus","name":"Pegasus: a factory worker","number":"0094","time":"1949-1964","date":"08\/24\/49","gender":"M","age":"A","text":"We were swimming in a small pool of water and playing ball for some manager; on Trust was thought my mind.

The guy with the video camera handed it to this other guy and said \"can you see anything?\" and this other guy said \"he's got a camera\" and then he shot him. Scully saw and realized the cameras were guns. They wrestled the guy for it and he shot the 'bomb' before they grabbed him. The guy in charge came in and it was Joshua Jackson but he was young. I was thinking that he was turning up everywhere lately. Then the point of view was of a young couple. The alarm was going off and they split up and the girl started running down the stairs in a stairwell but now it was me. I ran out at the basement level and this guy was directing everyone outside. It was raining. We were standing in front of the building and there was a window on an upper floor with some people just sitting and watching. One of them was James Van Der Beek and I was like 'more people from Dawson's Creek!'. It was cold and I had shorts on and was soaked. There were people still running out and I saw Eugene and Bradley. Eugene had longer hair and he was wet too. I then thought that I was at State University. When they were 'satisfied' this bubble went over the top and covered us so we didn't get rained on. We had to sit down. I sat down near Terrence and Gavin came along and sat next to him, then this other guy came and we moved to fit him in. Then Emery came and we had to move again. Then I was at home and he was staying over. I was sitting with him and Ezra in a bedroom and he had these dildos on the bed. One was purple and Ezra hit me in the head with one. Then I was on the floor watching TV. I saw an ad for Dawson's Creek with Pacey talking to Jen. I clapped excitedly.

It is hooked up to the water line.\" The colored lady went upstairs to where the white man was batching, into his room. I could hear them sing and they were talking and giving hints as to what they were doing and it was they were intimating according to what I heard. We were near a pond of water. We saw two odd-looking reptiles in the water. There was a clothesline rope in the water and it began to move like a snake. Audrey was walking on it barefooted. I yelled at her to get off. It was a snake, but she walked over and it didn't bite her. I was sitting on the railroad track with Bob and it was in Rivertown. I looked at a bank that was rocky. I told Bob we used to slide down that hill when I was a boy. I said, \"See how low that is, but when I was a small boy it looked high.\" I looked farther up and there was a very high bank that was farmed now. I told Bob, \"Now that is very high.\" It was a rocky cliff. I was looking at the results and I saw a lot of winners, but I can't recall them now when I'm awake. I met Chuck Parker, Norm Sherman and their families. They were lounging around on the lawn. I said, \"Boy, what a life you fellows have.\" Norm came up to me and monkeyed around. Then he said, \"Look into our room and see what I'm doing.\" I inspected it and he was taking off the paper and painting it in some places. He had paper on the wall all mussed up, spots where there was paper and just small pieces ripped off. It was a lousy job. I recall one winner now decorated. I went into the school of my boyhood days and they were serving meals. Bob got his and I got part of mine and then when I went for the rest of it, a friend of dad's hid my plate on the bench and I accidentally bumped the table and knocked the plate on the floor and the food dumped on the floor. He picked it up and thought I would eat it, but I walked out. I looked into a basket and saw hard buns in there. I was going to the store for a farm. Jim Lasko and I were picking up pennies we found.

Next I'm talking to Josie Hilgard, answering some rather elementary question about psychoanalysis that she has asked me. It suddenly occurs to me that she should know the answer, being an analyst herself. Then I'm at a party at the Hilgards (will actually be tomorrow night), and I'm kidding around with Josie about something. I am rolling around on the floor while she is telephoning. Quite gay for the old girl. Then I got into a bedroom or bathroom looking for some antihistamines or the like as my nose is running a lot. While I'm rummaging through a medicine cabinet, a disembodied voice that I know belongs to some physician I seem to know asks me what I'm looking for, and I explain. He offers me a thing that looks like a Tootsie Roll to chew on, which will do the same thing, but I argue that I can't go back into a dinner party chewing on a Tootsie Roll. It would be impolite, implying I didn't like the food. Then there is something unclear to the effect that some sort of hosing down of me every few minutes would also cure me, but I again argue that I can't keep popping out of this party to be hosed down in the courtyard. Then there is a gap in my memory, and the next thing I recall is that I'm about to marry some girl. I am using an assumed name, though, as if I'm wanted by the police for something. We are having a picture taken by this couple who does photography commercially, sort of at a fair. This couple looks very much like us. He knows who I really am, and while getting ready to take the picture of my bride-to-be and myself, says that he won't take it, just pretend to, but he will give us separate pictures which we must pretend are the picture of us together. He then calls me Melvin, indicating he knows who I really am, and I run off to escape from the police, who now are chasing me. A cartoon quality about this scene: I have run into a supermarket, gotten in by means of a chute. As police slide down the chute after me, they fall into a large grocery bag, which moves away on a conveyor belt. Now in the dream I and several companions are reading a series of cartoons about Donald Duck. Each one of the sequence is on a different can of frozen orange juice, and as the cans are not in order in the frozen food case, it's quite a job to follow these cartoons. I eat some ice from the case. Then I take some cans over to our cart, as now this dream is about my wife and I shopping in a supermarket we've never been in before. I notice that there are many interesting products in this market I've never seen before, and want to look around. I have also bought my wife a can of Salems, and am a little surprised at myself, but rationalize that this will be a good way for her to take them on a camping trip. I put a large piece of ice back in the frozen foods case, as it's more than I can eat.

He ordered Thai for himself so that people couldn't track him down by his nationality and his favorite food. I ran with them. The girl was kind. The older boy-man was not. He was brutal.

The little 2 room cabin they had was on the rock. A little bathroom where you had to climb through a window on the roof to get in was at a slant on the side. When I went in I pulled on the roof to climb into the window and the rock tower. The cabin was attached and came crashing down. First I thought it would fall on me. I stepped aside--it crashed to the street below--a winding mountain path. It took out most of the bathroom and their color printer that was in there.

They took my external hard drive too. There was a phone had the peoples' number in it. I called him and was speaking in a Spanish accent. We both were talking silly and then I was threatening to kill him, but I didn't say it seriously. I went downstairs and Tiana, Gilbert and Classmate-F-19 were in a car. They talked to me and asked me about my laptop.

I dreamt that -- I think this is where it starts -- I woke up at like 3:00 in the morning to go to the bathroom, and I had a dream before, but this is the only part I can remember now. Okay, I dreamt that I was in this portable classroom. I didn't know if I was at Westport College or Modern Media College, but I was at one of them, and I was in a portable and the lights were off. And there was carpet on the floor and there were like traditional student desks. And we were going to have a presentation by Bill Putnam, who's the sound engineer, great. He's left us now, but in my dream he was still alive and he was going to come give a lecture. And for some reason I had this, it was listed in like a program that he was going to give a concert on a Hollander B3 organ, and so he came in the room, he talked to us a little, he greeted us, he was like in his 70's. He was kind of in his 70's or 80's and he kind of barely knew what he was doing. [laugh] And he was talking to us, and before I knew it, he was doing this mime of like trying to show that there was these rotten eggs and how they were smelling, and there were these teddy bears, these teddy bear heads on a stick that somebody was swirling around above the supposedly rotten eggs. And there was like a little _________ things. He was doing this whole mime, and, of course, I wasn't getting much out of it because I couldn't see what the heck he was doing. And about three desks over, to my right, kind of in the front of the room, there was this guy, kind of like a side man with a keyboard, that was supposed to play like chords and all that were going on behind the mime to kind of give it some music. And this guy was like bad, to say the least! [laugh] He was like, I don't know, it just sounded really, really bad and he didn't know what he was doing either. He was just kind of like banging around, and it didn't go with anything that was going on. And then, I don't know what happened, but the scene just sort of like suddenly switched, and we were supposed to go on a boat trip at night. I keep having dreams that Dad and us and the family are supposed to go on this boat. And so I dreamt that we were going on a boat trip, and I don't remember where we were going, but I know we were going to go at night. Oh, I remember -- this is kind of crazy, man. I don't know where this came from, but apparently, I think I kind of visualized this when we were out on our walks and this is where it came from, but I was supposed to be on the boat and sing and give a concert to some thousands of people who were along the shoreline and on docks and at the Coachman and the park and stuff. And apparently not only was I supposed to sing, but I was supposed to play too, and I had an instrument for me there on the boat, or at least I thought they were going to have one there for me. It's one of those things where you think it's going to be there, but you never see it, I guess because, I don't know, but anyway, it was supposed to be there, and it was supposed to be there, supposed to be there. And I get on this boat and it's there, and we were like getting settled and stuff and we're ready to take off, and I'm ready to stand up there and sing to the people out there, and the instrument starts shrinking and shrinking and shrinking and shrinking and shrinking. And next thing I know it's the size of like something for a Barbie doll. And [laugh] the captain of the boat told me that I should take it home and put it in the bird cage for Archie [laugh], that he would want it and that he could benefit from it because he could learn some notes to sing. And like that's bizarre, man. And I think that is when I woke up. Man, man, man -- as _______ would say. I think I can start maybe unraveling where this dream may have come from. First of all, the Bill Putnam thing came from me reading the studio book, of course, but why he would come in and do a mime about rotten eggs? Don't ask me! [laugh] But it's becoming more obvious to me where the singing and playing on a boat would have come from. Astrid has been making up stories about Phil Collins sailing through the Straits of Silla and Corybdus, and playing Silla's favorite piece on the keyboard, which is, I think it is, I don't know, it's called \"Farralene\" (?), it goes [singing] and a couple others, the theme of the Titanic and different things like that. And I guess seeing the boat parade, hearing her stories about that, and being down at the waterfront and visualizing a floating stage and everybody on land watching a performance out there. All that came together and made this bizarre dream. Now the shrinking, I think might be something to the effect that it seems so close, but it's not. And, if you know what I mean, and I don't know, just something goofy that came out of that, I guess.","character":"1MKA, 1ISA, 1ISA","emotion":null,"text_len":4987,"word_count":995},{"id":"b","name":"Barb Sanders","number":"1788","time":"1960-1997","date":"1991-03-04","gender":"F","age":"YA","text":"I have someone look at my wisteria bush.

We decided to take this path. It was stone covered with these big, softball size, smooth stones. We took this path and it went down this hill, it was winding, curvy, and kind of. in waking life I would have taken it very slowly or even been leery of taking it at all. But I just; we just soared down this winding path of stones. We ended up at this place where they were taping a soap opera. I think it was, the one with Rick and Phillip in it -Guiding Light I think. We got down there and I said, look they're taping this show. But it was like there was this clear, barrier there but you couldn't see it, between where we were and where they were taping. There were different areas where they were taping different parts of the show. I asked someone if we could ask for autographs and they said no, not while they were working. So we walked through the different areas and saw the show. As we came back through we saw they were done and several of them were walking away. I was excited and I said, They aren't working now. Can we ask for autographs? They said yes. I ran up and asked for an autograph from the man who plays Rick. He was really nice. He gave me his autograph then put his arm around me and hugged me. Then he gave me a kiss on the check. He was joking around and then he kissed me lightly on the lips. He kept hugging me and so I hugged him back. Then he kissed me again on the lips. Then I also got an autograph from the man who plays Phillip. There was another one that I asked for an autograph but I don't remember who it was. , Rick and I fell in love. We decided we wanted to be together but there was some kind of, some people there that seemed to be from another country, maybe India. They had something like magical powers or potions. This one woman had this bowl of this stuff; it was pretty blue and enticing looking. She wanted Rick to taste it and she told him it was going to do something really good for him. I kept saying, No, Rick. Don't. Don't. I just had a sense that it was going to either change his feelings for me or change him in some bad way. He ended up not doing it. There was another bowl. This one was a different color. She was trying to entice him with this and trying to convince him that this one was different because it was a different color. I don't think he did. We were trying to get away. Rick and I and Phillip and I don't remember if there was anyone else with us or not. We still had our bikes, but now there was also this flat bed truck and we were trying to load some things on this flatbed truck to take with us. It was mattresses and some luggage. Some of us were still on our bikes. three of us. It seems that there was another woman with us too. We were riding trying to get away. The scenery kept changing like magically and becoming dangerous. We just kept riding through it and as it we did the scenery kept changing and because we kept going and didn't let it stop us it finally went back to normal. The next thing I know we were at an airport. Rick and I and Phillip and I don't remember if there was anyone else with us or not. We put all of our luggage on these conveyor belts. This one man was checking our luggage and he asked for our certificate. He found one in a piece of luggage. He checked it and it was okay. I realized there were several copies and only one copy was right. I told Rick There. That one in that luggage is the right one. We need to make sure we have our hands on it so nothing happens to it. So he grabbed that piece of luggage and tried to find it but he couldn't. We were running out of time and he finally grabbed it off the conveyor belt and tried to find it. While he was doing that I went ahead with Philip and Phillip was way ahead of me. And I said Oh yeah, I remember we talked about this in counseling. That he is like this and doesn't mean to be rude and it doesn't mean that he doesn't care or anything just because he is way ahead. not considering me being way behind. So I went ahead. The only other thing I remember is that it all worked out okay.

It was some sort of community building.  There were sleeping bags on the floor.  I talked to my mother.  She told me of a job down the hall that she had referred my brother Stuart to.  It sounded excellent so I had her take me to see about it.  Stuart's application was on hold until he could get more information.  A lot of people were standing around.  My mother left.  I lingered, wanting to apply, but thought perhaps I was being rude somehow, so a minute later I followed, unsure why I shouldn't still apply for the job.  I went back to the center and started playing a game of pinball sitting in a corner.  I put in a quarter for a second game.  The table changed, and grew.  The second was toilet-related.  A guy playing a game to the left of me moved his elbow in front of me so I couldn't see the table.  I asked him to kindly move and he turned his game- it would be hard for me to get out when I was ready to leave.  The third 'table' was huge.  It was the end of a bed covered in stuffed animals, and there were some inflatable hot air balloons hanging from above.  The 'table' also included the areas to either side of the bed.  Sometimes the ball went where I couldn't see.  My left paddle started sticking.  Someone pointed out a higher paddle that I hadn't seen.  Then I rode on a subway.  I met an Asian girl who was somehow a coworker.  We talked for a bit and became better acquainted.  I got off at her stop with her; she was going to take me to meet someone.  An Asian man was with us as we walked through a dark enclosure up to two apartment doors.  The walkway was composed of 1-inch jagged rocks.  I was barefoot.  My left foot started to hurt some, but the walk was surprisingly painless for walking on such a rough surface.  The girl and I kissed, including a little bit of tongue.  I still had my retainers in, and I was sort of embarrassed\/self-conscious about the taste\/morning breath.

I went to a place that resembled the buildings around 12th Ave. and 13th St. These are the federal buildings where the jail is and stuff like that. I pulled over on a side street right off 12th Ave. at night, and I was just watching the traffic. I was real close to the Miami River bridge. I came back to the car and found a ticket on the windshield saying that I had parked crooked. When I parked there was no one there, so I didn't know. So I parked at an angle, and didn't know everyone was supposed to parallel park. I was the only car parked at an angle, but this ticket was not written on the regular form of type ticket paper. This was written, I had an old piece of paper laying on the seat, a piece of loose leaf paper, and the ticket was written out on that, and it said to report to a certain place in Coral Gables. I knew there was something wrong because you don't go to Coral Gables for a parking ticket, but I didn't question, I was going to question the matter, so I was going to walk to the jail, to the courthouse where I was and ask them about it first. While I was walking, there was a bus in front of me, a Miami Transit Co. bus, and on this bus a little side door opened, like on the Greyhound bus where the baggage goes. Anyway, there was a side door on it. This Volkswagen 3 unit car. It was made out of all stainless steel or aluminum. It said Volkswagen on it, and it was like a little bus in itself. It had three units on it like three little cars. This thing drove right into the baggage compartment inside it, drove right inside the baggage compartment of the Miami Transit Co. bus. I remember that because it turned right in front of me to drive into the compartment. This is why the compartment was made, for this little other. There was a compartment on the big bug and it was made for this little Volkswagen bus which was about 3 feet high and about 15 feet long. So I saw this and I didn't think much of it because I thought it was something natural and then I went to ask about my ticket. I got up to the steps. It was very confusing inside. They were just letting a whole bunch of prisoners go, and a bunch of bums were just walking outside. So I figured I would just forget about it and go over to the place where I was supposed to go.

And it was supposed to be the Las Vegas show, I think, but there was this grayish background, and I think that was just sort of a transient dream that just sort of happened. Oh, and earlier this week I had a long epic dream with many dumb, little scenes in it, and I don't remember any of them now, of course. But one of the scenes I do remember was that Mom and I were at the Oceanside Park, the place where you go before you come to the beach. And she was riding her bike and I was walking, and I had the feeling like we were coming home from the pier, because we had just been there. And I was ahead of her, and she was riding her bike trying to catch up to me. And I decided I was going to walk back to her on the bike, I mean walk back to her and her bike, and so that I could walk alongside her and talk and stuff like that. So I'm going back to her and all of a sudden a couple of sprinklers turn on and they're spraying right at the sidewalk like the ones at Modern Media College used to do. And I decided, \"Whoops -- I don't think I could go that way.\" And I was really afraid of these sprinklers in my dream. And so I turned around and kept going my own way, and I was going along my own way and going along and saying, \"Okay, she's just going to have to go through the sprinklers and get wet.\" And so I'm a ways down the road, and then all of a sudden all the sprinklers turn on and they're all spraying right at the sidewalk and they're in the grass too. There's more in the grass spraying all over the grass. So it's sprinkle city as far as I can see, and this park as far as I can see, which probably isn't that far. But anyway, I'm standing there surrounded by sprinklers, getting soaking wet, and yelling for help, except I can't really yell. You know how it is in a dream. And then I find a little place where there's an intersection of a sidewalk where I can stand right in the middle of the intersection and not get too wet, but I'm still surrounded by all these sprinklers and I'm scared to death for whatever reason it is. And eventually Mom comes on the bike and her big back basket is as big as her front basket, and she puts me in her back basket and rides off, and I'm not getting wet any more once I'm on the bike, and I'm not even really afraid of the sprinklers any more. And then I faded into some other stupid thing. I thought this was just something dumb that occurred in my mind, but when I told Mom about it, she said that the sprinklers represent the circumstances of my life right now, I think, because I feel like I'm being surrounded and sort of led astray to some degree by going back to school, and I'm being kind of wrestled down and -- what should I say? -- closed in and trapped by all of that stuff. And I kind of tend to agree, I think. And, you know, she always tries to rescue me from bad emotional situations. So I guess that's what that is.","character":"1FKA, 1FKA","emotion":"AP D","text_len":3611,"word_count":729},{"id":"vietnam_vet3","name":"Vietnam Vet: 2016-17 dreams","number":"0288","time":"2016-2017","date":"2017-03-25","gender":"M","age":"A","text":"Outside, in a lush tropical country, I'm attending a party or gathering.

There was a large group of people outside around one of the sidewalks. Ben D was standing on the sidewalk facing and talking with another person standing on the sidewalk to his left. I was walking down this sidewalk and was going to need to walk right between them to get through. As I did, Ben D turned to see who was coming. I reached up with my right hand and rubbed the back of his head. He looked very rough, almost scary. He had tattoos covering most of his head and some on his arms as well. As I rubbed his head, I smiled, and just kept walking. I saw him again later, but just from a distance. I was thinking about how much I dislike tattoos and that it was disappointing to see that he had gotten them, especially so many and in such prominent places. There was a final program being held in an auditorium. The final conference gala would be held that evening. I left to go begin getting ready for the gala. I encountered Ben D once again on the sidewalk. This time he was with some other, considerably younger men, who looked just as rough as he did, if not more so. Because he was not in the middle of a conversation with someone else, I stopped to talk with him this time. He was being very unkind, even mean. He told me that all of this time that I thought we were friends he had just been using me, and now he wanted nothing further to do with me. I heard what he was saying, and saw his facial expression while he spoke. Still, something in his eyes led me to believe that he didn't really mean it, but was saying it because these other younger men with him wanted him to tell me that. These men were trying to control who Ben D's successor would be, for his work. They especially wanted to make sure that it wasn't a woman. I headed back to my room. Ben D and the other men followed me. My roommate had already packed and checked out. It was dark outside. I was very nervous about them following me. They wanted to come into my room. I told them no and that I had to pack and check out. I could see some of the staff on the floor above me. They said that I needed to pack and leave because it was past checkout time. The men that were with Ben D forced their way into my room and told me that I was to have sex with Ben D and then they also wanted me to have sex with another one of them, maybe more than one at a time. I was repulsed by the very suggestion. After that, they wanted me to have no further interaction with Ben D, ever. I didn't even want to be with Ben D at that point. Ben D was dressed in something that almost looked like some type of costume. It was scary in appearance. It was black, skin-tight, and covered nearly his entire body, except that his penis stuck out of it. I finally gave in and had very brief intercourse with him. There was nothing loving or caring about it. There was no kissing or cuddling, only intercourse. After just a few minutes, I stopped and told them all to leave. They did.","character":"1MKA, 1MSA, 1MSA, 2MOA, 1FOA","emotion":"AP D, SD D","text_len":2966,"word_count":583},{"id":"hall_female","name":"College women, late 1940s","number":"0449","time":"1946-1950","date":"Code 064, Age 21, 12\/08\/47","gender":"F","age":"Y","text":"I am in a department store (resembling H--).

I get on an elevator going down, but when we get to the basement I notice the belt of my dress is missing. We return to the same floor and then find that the belt is in the elevator. I put it on, and at first it doesn't seem to match the dress, but then later it does. We return to the basement. The style show is already in progress. The audience seated in rows or benches, seems to be composed of all young people. A girl whom I know is master of ceremonies. She brings out a dog and a duck and says they allow no petting there. Then I wondered if perhaps I hadn't heard wrong, maybe she said \"We allow no pets here.\" One of the models has already gone on the stage. I wonder where the other models are and where we are to go. Another girl is with me, I don't know who she is. We go into a little building. One wall is off allowing us to see into it. I see girls lying in bed in P. J.'s studying. I then see a girl (who is in my S-- class). She is fully clothed. I ask her if she knows where the models are. She goes to the window and points to a small building. I ask her how I can get there. I think perhaps I can climb out the window, but when I look down I notice that it's quite a jump. I ask her if there is a back door and she says \"yes\" We go out the back door and see a group of girls standing in a row.

Gwen begins to descend; I'm irritated by this because I am now holding on for dear life and she's calling out to me, which is a major distraction. Cautiously looking downward, I see Gwen sliding down a water slide made of the same red clay, but very smooth. She's sliding down and yelling happily, for me to come join her. I want to; she looks like she's having so much fun, but the rocky edge I am clinging to has created a chasm between us. I'm so scared and afraid. I wish someone would make the jump with me. Suddenly an old man is standing beside me on the edge of the cliff, beckoning me to join him to jump. He jumps down to Gwen. The slide slopes into a pool where there are lots of other people laughing and splashing. Gwen is in the pool and calls for me to come down, but she cannot see how high up I am from her. Suddenly a new hot, clay-red boulder begins to emerge from the earth. It is huge and is shaking the foundation I am desperately trying to cling to. It erupts slowly taking my boulder higher. I can barely make Gwen out. I still hear her though, she sounds like a screeching mouse: \"Kerry, Kerry, come down.\" I give up trying to jump or descend. I feel a lump in my throat, I want to cry.

It was time for me to present. There were people waiting. I went in deciding that I could do this with no problem. I would just do it off-the-cuff but it would still be a quality presentation. I suddenly felt confident that I knew enough to pull it off. I gave the people in attendance a brief explanation of what I was going to be doing. I told them I was going to pose a series of questions and give them time between each question to write down their own responses. At the end, I was going to have each of them share their responses and then I would compare their responses to what I found with the study. I and quite a few other people were in a room that I can best describe as a multipurpose room. The people there that I know are the actor Treat Williams and a few of my high school girlfriends, such as Susan J, Freda L, and Dorothea D. There were a number of meeting tables set up and placed around the room kind of randomly, and there were chairs at the tables. I was feeling fairly anxious because I didn't think that I was well prepared for the presentation that I needed to give. There was something very unusual about the room where I was doing my presentation. There were three of these six-foot long tables set up in a row into and touching each other. At each end there was another table, sitting perpendicular to the row of tables. So a kind of U-shape. There were chairs set up just on the one side of the tables. The outside of the U. and then behind that there was like a wall of white flowy curtains that went from floor to ceiling. They weren't hanging still. It was as though there were air movement in the room that was causing them to kind of flutter. It was a very well lit room. Not a bright light, but a soft, very white light I also seemed to be going in and out of the room during the presentation. There was something about candles or candle flames. I and one other woman were both leaving the multipurpose room at the same time to go for a walk outside. She went out the door first, and I went out, right behind her and she headed off to the right and I headed off to the left. It was a wooded area. It was just coincidental that we were both heading outside to go for a walk at the same time. I had not gone very far and I noticed the music that was playing inside the room. I kept thinking that I wouldn't hear it much longer, as I got further away. It was so loud, and I kept walking, and I still kept hearing it and I finally decided to turn around and go back and turn it down. Because otherwise it was just going to be too annoying and I wouldn't be able to relax and enjoy my walk. I'm surprised that I had turned it up that loud to begin with. It seems that I also had to walk through a wooded area to a clearing, where there was a building that a home. That's where the room was where I was getting my presentation. There are a lot of people in the multipurpose room. By a lot I mean maybe 15 or 20. Several people had just come back from a presentation where they had received an award for some type of quantitative research. We were talking about it and we were all very happy for them. It seems to me that there was a group of us in this room. Maybe all of us in the room were part of a professional group or academic group or social group. We have some kind of connection like that. No. Our connection was research outside of the Association we were talking about the various awards that were presented for research there. I asked someone about awards for qualitative research someone laughed and said, \"You mean like yours?\" I said yes as an example but I don't mean specifically mine. They didn't believe me. I said, I'm just wondering if there is value for our group to pursue awards for different types of research other than just quantitative. They just keep teasing me, and trying to make it all about me wanting an award for my qualitative research. There is a tabletop Christmas tree set up. We all brought presidents and put them on the table under the tree. Susan J had brought in a large gift that I had brought. It was wrapped, but it wasn't in a box. You would almost suspect it to be something like a blanket. It was soft. The gift wrap was torn on one of the large sides. Someone had tried to tape the tear. It was kind of a long tear. Someone had used two or three pieces of tape. The tear was part of what looked to be a piece of a separate wrapping paper. I had folded the edge under and taped the piece on top of the rest of the wrapping paper. I only did it for decoration. Susan J had either written something on the package or said something to someone about me having a romantic interest in Treat. I was so embarrassed by this and thought it was so school girlish. Someone saw something in the wastebasket and they pulled it out and said what is this? Treat and one or two other women walked up to her and were looking at it. As they were talking, I realized what it was. Icon up in Iran over there and took it from her and said, \"Oh that's just some old return address labels of mine.\" They gave me a very strange look, because they all said Elizabeth H. So I explained to them, or I just briefly said well, I changed my name. I really didn't want to go in to it with them why I changed my name, and why those labels even had a different first name. I didn't see any more, and I just put them back in the trashcan. They all still had very often looks on their faces. There was some place that a number of us needed to go, and we needed to go by car. We were trying to decide if we could all fit in one car. I mention that my girlfriends had a car, and if any of them were going that would solve the problem. We could just divide up between the two cars. I walked up to Susan J or one of the others and asked them if they were going so we can make plans accordingly. It seems as though this multipurpose room was all so, the area where we were doing dressed or ready for wherever else we were going. We were using this space to do individual preparation for presentations, but we were also using it for grooming. It seems to me that Treat knew that I had some level of personal interest in him. It didn't seem to bother him. However, he also didn't do or say anything to encourage it, reciprocate, or to indicate any mutual feelings. There was certainly nothing uncomfortable or awkward about it, or about the way he interacted with me, even though he knew that. It was more a feeling of warmth or fondness. Some of the other people there felt that it was inappropriate for me to have those feelings. Even though I wasn't acting on those feelings. I have no idea why it would be inappropriate, or why someone might think it was inappropriate. I was returning to the room from walking somewhere outside. When I got to the door I had my key in my hand, but he was standing there also getting ready to put his key in the door. We chatted casually and briefly about something related to the door being locked, or the keys.","character":"2JSA, 1MKA, 2FKA, 1FSA","emotion":"AP D","text_len":7015,"word_count":1367},{"id":"bay_area_girls_456","name":"Bay Area girls: Grades 4-6","number":"358-06","time":"1996-1997","date":"6th grader, 01\/26\/97","gender":"F","age":"C","text":"I dreamt that I was playing truth or dare with my friends Ryan, Devin, Lisa, Jerry, Courtlyn, and Jordan.

I am disappointed because I lost my lead as we are all stopped there. I push a button on the side wall and a blind raises. But there's another one there. I push the button again and this keeps happening. Finally the last one is raised. Judith rushes to get through first but then falls, I grab her foot and she is suddenly dangling over a long drop. I hang on tight and slowly pull her up. It is difficult. She turns and I get a grip on her leg and she climbs with my help to safety. Her chair had fallen. I look down and am shocked to see how long a drop it is. I offer her a ride on the back of my wheelchair. Dora is now walking with a stroller to push. We coordinate how we are going to return down the incline and find another way to our destination.","character":"1FKA","emotion":"SD D, CO D","text_len":1397,"word_count":291},{"id":"van","name":"Van: a video gamer","number":"051","time":"2007-","date":"06\/30\/08","gender":"M","age":"A","text":"I was on a road trip, and stopped off at a Wal-Mart, with an RV-tailgate area in the parking lot.

We are seated outside a house, where inside are some of my relatives. Derek is holding a baby girl and I am holding a baby boy. We are not speaking because I am hurt and angry at him. My baby boy squirms and fusses and I move him around until I have him seated on my lap facing me and I cuddle him. He settles down contentedly. It's soft and loving. Then my mother comes out and says, \"It's time for the presentation.\" I am annoyed because I want to stay with this warm, loving feeling with the baby. I then hand the baby to a woman and wheel inside. I see a huge room, where many people are seated around in a circle, on ritzy couches and fancy chairs. I look for a good place to put myself so I can see everyone and they can see me. Derek is now on one of the couches. I avoid him, taking great pains to snub him and not give him eye contact. I chose the head of the room, by the huge fireplace. There is also a skeet shoot apparatus up on the wall to my left. Derek encourages the rich man who lives in this mansion to shoot the birdie. He tries a couple of times, but it is all weak and ineffective. A silly coo-coo type mechanical bird flaps his wings, and a sort of pop gun goes off. Now I begin my lecture. I want to keep it informal and answer questions. The topic is dreams. I say, \"I know lots of things about dreams and my bias is Jungian, but I don't want to inundate you with all this. Just ask me what you want to know and I'll try to answer it.\" I am watching the words I use so I don't trigger Derek's automatic responses around 'know-it-all left brain language.\" Some ask some questions and it goes on. Now it's over and a man, like Richie, Kyle's brother, also a rich man from this mansion, is seated on my right. He is telling me how much he has wanted to meet me because he'd seen pictures of me and I'm fabulous and he loves me and would like to have s-e-x with me. And he goes on like a star-struck fan. I say to him, angry and bitter, \"I am 51 years old. You are young. This is stupid and won't work.\" He ignores me and prattles on and on, very gushy and intense. I want to leave now. Derek is nearby watching. Now I'm on a couch and a bookshelf contraption slides in front of \"Walter\" and myself to give us some privacy. I want to leave. He grabs me and tries to kiss me. I fight and scream, \"Leave me alone, no no!\" I break from his grasp, and I see Derek is frantically getting into his chair to come beat up Walter and protect me. I am sobbing violently and deeply. I drive away in my chair to the van and Derek follows. I am screaming, crying and he won't leave me alone. He hangs onto my handles and hitches a ride with me; he is concerned and loving. I am deeply hurt and sad. This Walter, who I don't like and don't want, wants me. Derek, who I love and want, won't have me. It has been this way all my life. It's not fair.

Chris A was going to be arriving at the very last minute so she had also asked me to do what I could beforehand so he could get ready very quickly. I was in a very large open room. I don't see anything in it. Yet, I picked up a bottle of body wash and put some into a sink. As I did so I also closed up the sink drain and allowed hot water to fill the sink. I had a new shower sponge with me. I tore off the tags and laid it by the sink. Next I laid out all the pieces of his tux on something. Just as I was finishing Chris A walked in. He was dressed in what would be usual attire for him. jeans, boots, plaid shirt over a t-shirt, cowboy hat. But he was much taller and much thinner than in waking life. I didn't even take time to give him a hug but as I walked away I half-turned around towards him. I pointed to where his things were as I mentioned the sink of water that I had prepared in case he needed or wanted to wash up. He said he had taken a shower before he came. I think he said at a truck stop. I was in such a hurry because I realized the wedding was supposed to start in 5 minutes and I was not dressed yet. I knew Kim H would be very upset with me but also didn't feel that there was anything I could have done differently to have been able to get dressed earlier.

The time was in the present, and I had just come home. The first thing I can remember was coming out of a neighbor's house. In the house I vaguely remember talking with a group of people--who I think I knew. I then got an old piano stool and began to ride it down a small hill. After a few trips down I got tired of this and looked over to another neighbor's house. In his yard there was an old racing car. I then took the piano stool, which had somehow changed into something else on four wheels, and tossed it into the pile of antiques I had taken it from. I thought I might have bent one of the wheels, but I didn't take a closer look. I went to this second neighbor's basement (which was open--much like a garage--however, not in actuality) and started looking around then at antiques. There were about three cars there and boxes of other things. I picked up a slot machine which had been used to figure out income tax. It worked this way. You pull the handle to spin the dials. Whatever numbers came up is the amount you pay--unless you hit the jackpot, then you get money. (Wow!) I remember this thing was light and looked as if it had been made in Japan from tin cans. After looking at a few more things, I left. I went home because we were supposed to go with my father to see about getting a new Jeep or Land Rover. My brother was shaving when I reached the bathroom. After he finished, he told me that he had been down to see the Jeep dealer and found that Dad could get a Jeep fully equipped with all the accessories he wanted for the price of the bare land Rover. I told my brother that this wouldn't work on Dad. He had his mind made up on a Rover and it would be almost impossible to change. He agreed with me. I then came into the bathroom as he was finished shaving. I noticed that the toothpaste tube was floating in the toilet bowl. My brother said it had slipped off the sink. My brother then began talking about changing because he wanted to wear an undershirt under the shirt he had on if he was going to see this Jeep dealer. I told him that was foolish. In Florida few students wear them because of the heat. I then remember thinking that it was probably 95 degrees in Miami and clear (it was cloudy and cool at home). He agreed with me, but then looked and found he was wearing one anyway. I then remember cleaning a large plastic tube about _\" in diameter and 10' long. The part I was cleaning was a fitting on one end. It seems somehow that this was part of the razor, but I am not sure. I got a lot of water on the floor from cleaning it as it ran through the tube. I then began to talk to my brother more about the Jeep deal. I said that surely the dealer could offer the price he did for the outfitted Jeep--all he would have to do is to take the stuff off the old Jeep and put it on the new one. The same thing could be done with the Rover. I cannot remember much beyond this. The last scene in my mind before I woke up was something about a hired girl we have living with us and some bunnies she had.","character":"2JSA, 1MKA, 1MKA","emotion":null,"text_len":3117,"word_count":618},{"id":"kenneth","name":"Kenneth","number":"0941","time":"1996-1998","date":"07\/07\/1997","gender":"M","age":"Y","text":"<i>Mountain Bicycling<\/i> <br\/><br\/> I'm riding a mountain bicycle down 3rd Street in Wilmerton going west past the intersection of 3rd and Bar Avenue.

And there was a little orange cat in the store and it was supposed to be very dearly loved by some group of policemen in another city, mascot or something, but here the police didn't like it and there was a policeman who was trying to catch it. It was running under the checkout counter. The little cat was hiding and the policeman was bending down to get it. I went over and told the cat to bite the policeman, but the cat didn't and the policeman picked it up and walked out with it and I thought the policeman would say something nasty to me because I had told the cat to bite him, but he didn't say anything. So I went back around, and this checkout girl who was checking out my groceries and the girl at the counter beyond that were in sympathy with the cat too and the people who owned it and I was in sympathy with it too. We thought that they were going to try this cat and put it in jail. It seemed sort of silly, but that's what was going to happen. So we were all going to write postcards to the higher court or something telling them what we thought about the case. So the girl at my checkout counter had some postcards that were sort of form postcards for this sort of thing because they had several questions to answer briefly. It would seem to be sort of unusual questions for this sort of thing because, for instance, one asked if the tires on your car were worn and another one asked what made you different from the people who are writing in postcards about this thing. I said we the people who wrote in had more concern for others than the people who didn't, but I finally did finish filling out the postcard and then I wrote a check for my groceries, and went out to the car and my mother and my older brother and my sister and my daughter were all waiting there in the car for me. My mother had brought me to think I made them wait for hours and hours. I was quite sorry about it, but we all got in the car and mother started driving. She just drove real recklessly and it was really very upsetting, pulled out into the car where all these cars were zipping along at about 60 and she just pulled out and we went so slow she had to stop and start over again. Meanwhile all these cars piled up around her and almost ran into her and lots of them had to run off the road because they were going so fast. She didn't particularly care to be rebuked about it. She didn't think there was anything particularly wrong about the way she was driving. We were starting to drive thru this very small town when I was sort of a car and sort of a horse, more of a horse, and I was sort of just pretending to be one which was very strange. But at any rate I was going thru this very small town. I was cantering along when I met this sign that said all horses must proceed at a trot so I slowed down to a trot and stopped at several stop lights. Finally came into a little narrow corridor. This whole town was famous for its antiques. There were lots of antiques along the streets before, but now I was in this little house which displayed all sorts of them, part of the town and part of the main street. I trotted along slowly looking at them and turned the corner and went down this narrow little hall, turned again, and there was this sign saying you are now leaving this park, Hallborough. And so I was back out in the open again. That was about the end of that dream. Hallborough, which is next to my university town, is about the most unhistoric place you can think of. The most uninteresting of anything. The little town of Millsborough which is a little ways away would be a much better place for this thing.","character":"1ANI, 2MOA, 1MOA, 1FKA, 2JSA, 1FKA, 1FKA","emotion":"SD D, AP D","text_len":3713,"word_count":723},{"id":"merri","name":"Merri: an artist","number":"032","time":"1999-2000","date":"06\/12\/1999","gender":"F","age":"A","text":"I was suppose to go along the fence backwards until I got it down good and was on a horse but nobody showed up to meet me.

It is fall, I think maybe late October, like around Halloween. I am with a man named Daniel [unknown in waking life]. He is tall, thin, with blondish-brown hair. He is very kind and yet very strong personally. We have a bunch of children with us. I think we are just sightseeing and such. We see this man sitting in a chair. I think he was playing music. His pants are unzipped and his penis is showing. As I notice it, his erect penis comes completely out of his pants and is laying flat against the chair. Right after this happens something black, reminds me of a worm but it wasn't that, slides down the length of his penis and disappears. I thought it was nasty and wondered what it was. As Daniel, I, and the children are sightseeing, we are participating in lots of local activities. It is a very small town, smaller than St. Joe, where everyone knows each other, gets along well together, and does many fun things together. We join them in some kind of choral concert. We, or the children, are singing with them. I feel more as if I am observing than participating but I'm fairly sure the children were participating. It feels as though Daniel and I are taking an open carriage ride in the early evening, though it is dark. We are talking about how wonderful and beautiful it is there and how great it would be to live there. We talk especially about what it would be like in the winter, with the snow, and at Christmas. It wasn't snowing, the leaves had all turned colors, it was beautiful, and the air was crisp and cool. Yet, I had a very clear picture of the area after a large snow. I could literally see it. I saw a couple of men clearing snow from their cars. One has a shovel and seems to be trying to get snow out from under the front driver's side wheel well. Then I'm back to reality and noticing the beautiful fall colors again. I notice two little tiny people in a tree. One male and one female. They are maybe only two inches tall. I have a sense that I see them and yet at this time I also feel like I might be the female. It may be that the male lives in that tree but the female is just there, visiting. They are somewhat concerned, but not terribly, but something that is happening. The tree begins to shake. A little bit later, Daniel and I are back with the children doing something else. One of the children finds two little flat things lying on the ground. They appear to be the kind of plastic clear and color decals that I put on my windows at Christmas time. These look like the two tiny people. We realize that whatever happened to the tree did this to them, that the two little things, were actually these people and they were now gone for good. It was sad and yet okay both. There is another adult. We called him Cooter. He is in the car with Daniel and a little girl. He said something to the little girl about Uncle Cooter always being there for her. The next thing I know Daniel and I are back home, to my home, with the children. It is a very lovely middle-class home. We try to get all the children into bed. I don't know where Cooter is at this time. I am observing this and yet at the same time feel as though I am the woman. I go to the other end of the house. It seems to be a long house because there seems to be quite a distance between the children's room and my room. Daniel came into my room. I am already dressed for bed in a spaghetti strap satin full-length nightgown. I lay down on top of the blankets. Daniel lies down with me and is holding me. We are discussing him staying there with me. possibly marriage. living with us. I get the sense that the children are foster children. There are a number of boys and I think just one girl. This next part is weird but I will explain as best I can. I suddenly feel as though I am Daniel and that I am holding the woman. I am holding her in a way that my right arm is running parallel to and cupping her legs, buttocks, and back. It's kind of like I am a huge person and at the same time this entire part of her body is the same size as the length of my arm. There is also the sense that I am holding both the woman and Daniel. I think we finally decide that we will give it a go. sharing the home and love of and care for the children. I don't know if that means marriage or simply living together though. It almost seems this is another scene but there is discussion about Cooter and what will happen to him. He doesn't have a place to live. My first thought is to turn a shed in the back yard into a bedroom. I realize then that he would be coming in and out of the house using our kitchen, bathrooms, etc, and we Daniel and I wouldn't have any privacy that way. I suggest that we build him an apartment over the garage.","character":"1MSA, 2JSC, 2MSA, 1MSA, 1FSC","emotion":null,"text_len":4764,"word_count":929},{"id":"norman","name":"Norman: a child molester","number":"297","time":"1963-1967","date":"09\/02\/64","gender":"M","age":"A","text":"I was searching through strange streets looking for a certain neighborhood.","character":null,"emotion":null,"text_len":75,"word_count":11},{"id":"norms-m","name":"Hall\/VdC Norms: Male","number":"0049","time":"1940s-1950s","date":null,"gender":"M","age":"Y","text":"I was just entering a dormitory on campus to call on a young lady.

Of course, I kept going because I was directly under the light when it turned red. As I got closer to R1 Rd., there were road crews working here and there. I think they were filling potholes. There would be two or three men at each of these different places and traffic was going pretty fast with this construction workers right there. They did not have it marked well so you would even notice them very far ahead. They weren't using orange cones or anything. Some of them were working along the side of the road to my right.

They were in there to watch a PHS event from the window. PHS was right across the street. Their practice football field was right outside our window. They were watching the band practice. The band was in uniform. Apparently maintenance had left my front door open so people were just coming in and sitting in Matthew's room watching the band practice. I thought, How dare they just come in here and do this. A little girl wanted something to drink. I didn't want to encourage this so I decided to take her across the street to get a drink of water. It was like we lived on a city street. She didn't like it that I did that. She was about 3 years old. I brought her back to her mother and went downstairs to the kitchen and these two young girls came in and asked if they could have some more of my chocolate chip ice cream. They were already eating some. They had taken it and put it on cookies. I thought, how dare they just help themselves to the food in my kitchen, too. I just thought that the next time I am just going to have to make sure that my door stays shut and locked so people can't come in like that. I was talking to some woman. I think she was a sister. We were talking about some place that I wanted to get a job. I said, well, it's on the same block as PHS. She acted like she either didn't know what I was talking about or didn't believe me. So I pointed out through the window. PHS looked like a city school. It was a several story, red brick building. I pointed just past it, a couple of buildings down. I said see it's that one. She said oh yes. I said, see, it's in the same block as PHS. She said yes, yes. Later she was packing all of her things and telling me that she just took a new job there. I thought, Well. How strange is that? I just got done telling her that I was trying to get a job there and now she is telling me that she has a job there.

Only the room was a mix between the most cluttered of my college apartments and the sparingly decorated extra bedroom upstairs in the house my grandparents have lived for the past quarter-decade. Four monitors were there. Two double displays, a long, modern single display and a smaller computer monitor set aside for my xbox. I wondered at both the waste and the potential utility. But I was please to have such an array -- just think of the organization! She came in as a small bird, burrowing through the ground. When she emerged, she was a woman changed. Or trying to change. The magnetism was there like always, only now, there was little facade of reticence. We seized upon each other, and we fell on the bed, the thick blankets all around. We took off our clothes. It wasn't a ravenous mutual stripping, but more a slow, casual progress toward the inevitable. I could see tattoos on her body. I doubted many were real, but even if they were stick-ons, their placement on her nubile body, the intricate swirls and flowers and dragons, attracted me to her in a new way. There was a mirrored design in that flat space between each of her breasts and shoulders. Her abdomen was covered with more, in attractive, symmetrical columns. I told her I liked this. It was the way she was showing her change. I trusted her, and she trusted me. She lay down, and I lay on top of her, finding my way in. Just like I remembered. Not long after we had started, I felt a paranoia. What can happen, will happen. We should cover up, just in case someone comes in. I reached back and pulled the old white comforter over us. With renewed vigor, I re-attached myself to her. Then a moment later, the door swung open, with a column of relatives at the door. My grandmother and grandfather were there, even though grandpa is long dead. Before I could say a word, Cindy blurted: \"Hello Mr. Grandpa!\" I said something nonsensical, meant to be a rock onto which the sponges of their desire to make an excuse for themselves to grow.  The door did not slam shut again as you would expect. Instead, everyone came in. I rolled over and brought the blankets back atop us. I jumped off the bed and put on pants. She covered up. They filed in. Sean (my 22 year old cousin), his friend, with a strange name, and perhaps others. We talked about miscellanea, and then, they urged us to go to church. I went along with the idea. Soon we were at a place with an exterior reminiscent of the library and art museum complex in the town where I went to high school. Inside was an auditorium, with a quiet, plexi-glass-covered press room and a tall crescent of seats, some of them doubles. Behind me, sat the church regulars. I walked in with my arm around Cindy, but she disappeared as I sat down. She was supposed to be right behind me. No matter. On a raised, square platform framed by a banister of dark-stained, glossy wood, an old woman with triangle-shaped, purple-dyed white hair spoke into a microphone, imploring questions about the scripture from the somewhat thin crowd. But this church was also synonymous with a performing arts center. It was as if the high school auditorium was transferred into a college auditorium near where I went to college, splashed with religious overtones. Grandma was occupied downstairs. She had somehow wanted to know what it was like to retrieve something from an oven herself. She'd shrunk down to an old, bird-like shape, like an owl with my grandma's face, her thinning hair turned into sparse and spotty down feathers. She was trying to carry a platter out from the oven (where the refrigerator is in her current kitchen setup) on her head, raised up with skinny, wing-like arms. How was she withstanding the heat? I said she needed to duck down a bit to make it out. Instead, she shrunk, turning into a tiny bird with an egg on her head, with curved, pin-like feathers sticking from the top, with pollen-like heads at the tips, like the stems inside a hibiscus flower. I washed her in the sink , careful not to knock off the intricate and endearing head display. But it fell into the garbage disposal. She was the size of a finch. In the middle of the question and answer sermon, a screen came down. Cindy had gone to do another performance. A voice from behind me, a peer-aged girl of hers, a sometimes friend, said \"not this one again. It's overrated.\" But when the images flashed on the horizontal rectangular screen, with hues of indigo and white, edges rough like a blueprint, I saw that her dance was more a model strut than anything else. Her henna-tattooed body writhed around a pole that extended up and down to infinity. She floated throw the air, trails of black star fire and sparkle behind her. Her chest was bare. Her oval breasts tinted gray in the filter. And in her final pose, an angle that surveyed her body from high above, the bones in her pelvis stretched the band of her thong just far enough to see the bump of her clitoris emerge from the horizon of her flat and toned abdomen. I said to myself, \"I hope all these people know I'm doing that.\" The show ended, and another woman with purple hair had taken to the platform, this time, shifted o the other side of the stage area. The original was now in the crowd. I raised my hand to ask a question, but put it down as the church women behind me chuckled to themselves that I should wait to see how things worked. I put my hand down, and some fat young man asked a stupid question. I wanted to ask about shellfish. The women asked what church I go to. I said non-denominational. I paused for a moment, and added, lying, Unitarianism . I waited to see their balk. Then the first purple-haired woman walked up the side-aisle, and an announced her name, followed by \"denominational\".","character":"1FKA, 1FKA, 2JKA","emotion":"CO D, AP D","text_len":5867,"word_count":1063},{"id":"b","name":"Barb Sanders","number":"0466","time":"1960-1997","date":"1981-06-11","gender":"F","age":"YA","text":"I am being asked to sing.

I was going to return by taking a long country road that ended directly in front of my home. If I kept riding in the same direction as the road I would ride directly into my driveway. This is not all like my waking life home. As I was riding various country roads toward my home I would come to intersections. The first couple of times I slowed way down, almost stopping, before turning onto another road. At the final intersection, however, I didn't slow down at all. I decided I could maintain my speed and navigate the turns without incident. The first was a 90 degree right turn and then less than a undred a feet further ahead was a 90 degree left turn. I navigated both successfully without toppling my bicycle. The left turn put me on the long straight road that led to my house. As I road I came to a large mansion of a home that was being built. I thought about the fact that I had stopped there some months before and talked to the woman owner about a job as property manager. I would guess the woman owner to be somewhere around seventy years of age, with lovely, silver-grey hair. I decided to stop and see if she was there and follow up with her. The structure was not yet completely enclosed so I just walked in through an opening. I saw several construction workers and asked one if the owner was there. I had barely gotten the question out when she walked up. I reintroduced myself and told her I was there to follow up with her regarding our previous conversation. She didn't seem to remember me, but was willing to talk with me again because she was still looking for a property manager to help her finish the project and then perform various functions once the building was completed. There was another younger woman there as well. She had blonde hair and was thirty or forty years old. She was not there the last time and did most of the talking this time. In building this project, they had moved some important items from another property. One item was a very large, beautiful, ornate driveway arch that was made of cement. It was a very pale salmon color and looked very regal. They had also relocated an old cemetery that had contained six or so gravesites. When they relocated it they had not reburied the coffins, all of which looked like the 6 sided pine boxes that were once used for burials. Each looked very weathered and had a cross on top. They were a hundred or more years old and had historical significance. There was something else that they had moved, also of historical significance. They had not done anything with either of these sites because they were waiting to hear what they were required to do, both legally and according to historic preservation requirements. Before I went in to find the owner I had looked at both of these sites again. I found them fascinating and thought it would be quite a bit of fun to recreate or restore these two historically significant sites. When I was inside talking to the owner and her younger employee, I mentioned these two sites. The younger woman said they were likely not going to do anything else with them as they recently learned they were not required to do anything. My first thought that this was disrespectful, especially to the people whose remains were in the coffins. They were intending to just leave the coffins sitting above ground. I knew immediately that if I were to get the job I would try to convince the owner to do something with both of these sites that would be both respectful of the individuals buried but also respectful of the historical significance of the two sites. After we finished talking I got back on my bike and continued my ride home. I had not gone very far when I saw someone else was building a new home, but this one was being build right on the road, so the only way to continue down the road was to ride through the home. It was not fully enclosed yet. I apologized as I was riding through, though there was really no alternative other than to ride through the grass. I decided to stop and see if I might be able to get a part-time, temp job with the construction company. I was talking to the project manager as he and two other men were working. One of the men didn't seem very competent and I could tell by the way the other two looked at each other that they were frustrated with him. I reached up and helped with something they were doing that the third man didn't seem able to do. They seemed impressed that I knew what to do and was able to do it. I told them that I'm not afraid of power tools, have some working knowledge of this kind of work, and can handle small tasks like this. The project manager told the other man they should give me a chance so the other man pulled out a sheet of paper and looked at to see when they could use me. He said I could come in at 3:30 and work until twelve. At first I thought he meant 3:30 in the afternoon. Since it was just going to be five hours a day I decided it would be fine. Five hours a day doesn't fit with the twelve o'clock stop time. Then he clarified that he mean come in at 3:30 in the morning and work until 7 in the morning. I started to say that I couldn't do that but then quickly said okay, thinking that the experience would be good and since it was only part-time it would be okay. I asked him about clothing requirements. He told me that I would need to wear dark grey pants, something like Dockers and a dark red golf shirt. I knew this meant that I would need to go shopping that day so I would have the clothes I need to go to work in the morning. I thanked him and got back on my bike to continue my ride home. After riding a short distance I came upon another house being built in the road. A little later there was a spa type business that was partially built in the road and partially on both sides of the road. I didn't understand how it could be that I hadn't seen it there before as I had to take this road to get from my house to another road or street to go anywhere. This spa had been there for some time. It had numerous regular customers, several were there at that time. None of it was fully enclosed, so it was exposed to the elements. The part in the road looked like a very large spa tub. It had lounge chairs sitting all around it and employees checking in with the customers sitting there to see if they wanted or needed anything. All of the customers were wearing thick, white, terry-cloth robes like you would typically see in a spa. Two women got up and walked to a part of the spa that was to the right of the road, talking to each other as they walked. I wondered how expensive their services were and thought it would be nice to be able to come here on occasion. As I continued my ride home there were several other businesses built on the road. It didn't even cross my mind how people get to these places since they are all built in the road and there is no other road leading to any of them. Several times I thought it seemed to be a long ride home. I didn't remember the road being nearly this long. I kept looking off into the distance to reassure myself that I was going in the right direction. It never looked like I was but I knew I had to be because off in the distance looked like nothing but landscape and I knew the other end of the road ended at an intersection with a bunch of buildings around on all four corners of the intersection and branching out in every direction. There were also a number of times when it all felt like I had this exact same experience before. It was similar to when I dream something and realize that I had dreamt it before, though I wasn't thinking about it being a dream at the time.","character":"1FSA, 2IOA, 1FSA, 1FSA","emotion":null,"text_len":7729,"word_count":1476},{"id":"peru-m","name":"Peruvian men","number":"M12-2","time":"1970","date":null,"gender":"M","age":"Y","text":"A rather comfortable house situated in the middle of a densely vegetated area.

His house was full of animals and clothing racks [possibly due to stocktaking so many clothing stores lately] with lots of 'sexy' women's clothes of all different sizes - implying that he had many lovers. I remember his last name was Willett, and I think his first name was Dean. We began sleeping together - his 'rule' was that he would pretty much sleep with anyone he wanted to and never got into a relationship with anyone. This carried on for a while. One day I went over to do something with the mice and he had another girl there (hispanic looking). I was unfazed and carried on with the mice and left. Some time later he started getting possessive and told me to not see anyone else (which I wasn't anyway). Then it was a movie and he was less attractive and had a weird, deep and ugly voice. There was a girl called Ivy who owned a bakery (or something like that) who he was now 'my character'. He also had this silver\/metal mark on his face and was a loud, fast talker (salesman-like). There were a few ensemble characters as well. It turned out that this guy was disturbed and a murderer and all the other characters had issues too.

I said \"I don't care about the radio!\". He took off and I saw Darren up the street and he looked like he had been hit and I said to stop because it looked like the guy's van in a driveway, but they still refused. There were other signs of the guy but they ignored me. I was really upset and angry and I said to Dad \"after I finish packing I never want to see you again!\". There was lots of wide stuff on the roads, palm fronds etc. Dad said he'd heard about stuff happening on the radio and I said that Mom had mentioned a bad storm coming earlier. Eventually they stopped, but it was too far away for me to get back home. I went into a shop and they left. There was now an apocalypse happening. It was partly my fault, I think. I had powers, like I could generate heat from my hands. The best way was to hold a small bean bag tightly and I made flames. I was in the DVD section and I was trying out my powers. I met up with a 9 year old girl who was quite pretty and knew about what was happening. There was some lava on the ground, which was coming from behind an aisle and it was like a slug. My hand got red, but there were no flames. A mother and her young daughter came along and asked if some movie was here and I said \"no... try here again tomorrow\" and the girl smiled and her mother said \"that's the most inspiring thing I've ever heard\" and I thought 'that doesn't even make sense' and the girl hugged her. They went away. I told the girl I was with that I wish I didn't know an apocalypse was happening tomorrow. We went down a back hall and Mom was now in the all of the loading dock. We walked there but she wasn't there and I said \"I don't know if that's a good or bad thing that she's not here\". There was some show, that I think was called \"You Look Young -- 59\", or something to that effect. There was a guy with two kids and it was quite funny. He was high and the cops were outside. He sent his kids out and then they were either with or were Cartman and Kyle (both from South Park) and they were singing?

The girl at the checkout was talking to Mom. I was looking down at the ground. I'd gotten a couple of lolly things and I said that I had been craving them. I looked up and realized the girl serving us had gone to one my schools for about a week or something. She didn't seem to recognize me. I was then on the internet and I was trying to find out stuff about Grey and what the toy was called. I found pictures of toy rabbits made by the same people. I read something about Facebook where this person had said \"it used to be MySpace, and now everyone is obsessed with Facebook\". Ezra still had his Grey and it had a tag with an internet address on it. I thought that was odd since the internet wasn't very popular when they came out. Dad and Ezra were watching a movie preview and it said 'shake it' and I thought 'they better not say 'like a Polaroid picture'' and then they said \"like a Polaroid picture\" and I said \"I knew he was going to say that!\" and was annoyed at Hey Ya. I found a site of some lady who would try and guess a word (to test out psychic ability or something). She had the word she guessed and the actual word. They were all really close. One of them was her guess was 'foot' and the word was 'food'. I was then walking with a girl outside. She could control people and so was making people do funny things. The cops were coming up the road so she made this person walk out in the road and almost got hit, so they came back and she made me start yelling at them. We got sent to a building. Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles were working there and they were the only people there. They interrogated us, but it was in the room in which you first enter the building. Jared got us to write down what had happened and Jensen did our fingerprints. The other girl finished first and it was my turn to get fingerprinted. Jensen called me over and I felt nervous. I asked if I just had to sit down and he said yeah. It was at a small table which was against the wall of that room, with one seat on either side. He did my prints, although it was only 3 fingers from one hand and two fingers from the other. Then we were having 'dinner', and I had two sandwiches except they looked like a CBA. We had a glass of yellow wine each. I dipped my finger in it and tasted it. It was sort of warm and I asked if could have water, saying I don't even drink coke and I was thinking of saying I don't even drink orange juice but couldn't be bothered. He convinced me to drink the wine, so I did. I was worried it was pee at one point. Then there was someone else there, I think, and they were worried that I was going to sneak off. Some real cops came and Jared told me to run now and I shrugged and kept eating. The person worried about me leaving mentioned they had cameras (so they would notice me leaving). Jensen and I finished the wine at the same time. He flirted with me a lot. A while later I needed to pee. I walked out of the building by myself and went to the toilet somewhere. I came back though. Jensen went to take a shower. I started exploring the place and I walked past the shower. It was open and he was facing away but he was naked, and I looked away and kept walking. There was a shelf with games and books on it and I recognized most of it from when I was younger. Jared and a lady joined me and I was going through the stuff going 'I remember this!' and excitedly looking at the stuff. Jensen came out, with a towel around him and asked what was happening. The others and I joked we were ignoring him and said \"let's go play Monopoly\". I then got a blood nose and when I turned around it splattered all over Jensen's towel. We started laughing. Jensen and I were laughing quite hard and I couldn't stop. I thought it may be because of the wine. There was a section with the recordings from the cameras and they were in video tape covers. One of them had 'Rose Red' written on it. I remembered misspelling Jared's name once as 'Jared Pinalecki'. I then woke up and I was in the passenger seat of a car. It was running and I was alone. It was daytime. I locked the doors. I had some of my dreams that I'd written down and I had a book where I was giving people character profiles. One of them said 'Guitar -- Dmitri' and I thought it was about Nathan Kohler. This guy in a grey shirt walked past the driver's window. I couldn't see his head though as it went higher than the roof. A little while later, he came back and started trying to open the driver's door. I still couldn't see his face. Although it was locked, it opened a little and I tried to pull it closed again. I was thinking I should start the car up and drive away.","character":"1FKA, 1FKA, 1ISA, 2JSA, 1FSA, 2MOA, 1MOA","emotion":"AN D, AP D","text_len":4677,"word_count":927},{"id":"alta","name":"Alta: a detailed dreamer","number":"259","time":"1985-1997","date":"5\/10\/89","gender":"F","age":"A","text":"I live in an apartment building - kind of one, I'm not real sure what it is - very open, has an open walkway with a railing, in front of the door that I've come in and out of.

I realized it was checking each of the addresses and phone numbers I had entered into each letter, verifying my addresses for correctness.  It would show a layout of a state, with major rivers and cities indicated.  Then it would show a black and white layout of a particular city in that state, and it would adjust, or re-picture the map, to adjust the correct telephone and\/or addresses I had entered against correct data it was receiving from current phone or address directories.  I realized it must be hooked up to some phone or address database by modem.  As it updated each of my addresses in the letters, it would re-picture the map it showed.  It moved methodically across the states and Mexico.  As I wondered about this, I realized that some of my letters had been to addresses in Mexico; that's why it was showing Mexico too.

He came across an item dealing with some new scientific information about oceanography, but had difficulty with making these statements so he ended that particular piece of news, so he continued on with other information. After a few minutes when he had finished with the news, he then said, \"Now, I would like to give you the information about that other news item which was a little bit garbled before. Here is the way that statement should have read.\" He then proceeded to very carefully read this off. Now it seemed as if there were some other woman present at the same time, and both of the male announcers were there carefully looking at this skirt while the announcement was being slowly read.  One word they were having difficulty in pronouncing was cataclysm. It seems as if they were saying that this is past tense of the verb to something and the word seemed cataclysm, but that isn't an infinitive. At the conclusion of this broadcast, there was some sort of contest where the announcer who had not been involved with reading the news, was now giving out some sort of information and then people were supposed to react to this with questions or comments or something to his statements. This woman who was mentioned earlier was going along and asking some different questions. It seemed as if somehow there must have been other people standing nearby or involved because none of them were saying anything. It seemed as if there were a little bit of annoyance at this woman because she was much involved with the question, and then the news announcer reminded that there was an $8 prize for the person who had asked the most questions or cooperated in whatever fashion it was that was expected of people in reaction to this information. The next part of the dream seemed to have involved some sort of intrigue or spy element. There was some earlier part that I can't recall as I'm not sure what information it was that was supposed to be kept secret or who all was involved in the plot. At this one point it seemed that a group of people were together. One of them is a friend of mine whose name is Dave Long and then there was some attractive woman who looked like one of the nursing students. There were several other people involved. They were all in the room and then it seemed as if Dave and this woman were the principle culprits and they were trying to escape. They were on some sort of subway like device or else an elevator that ran sidewards. They were supposed to get off at this one particular stop, but they didn't. Instead the machine that they were on which seemed to look more like the elevator arrangement inside whizzed by this one stop and the people inside seemed to be hardly aware that they had rapidly passed by. Then in order to throw people off the track, he decided to get off with this girl at a dentist kind of place thinking that no one would ever look for them there. It seemed as at one point when they were moving along in this vehicle that they looked out and there was a large auditorium filled with about ten or twelve people scattered throughout all of them very busily picking their teeth with a toothpick. When they stopped to get out of this vehicle it seemed as if I were there and it was some form of hallway. As Dave went by, I think it was myself than who had a bowl of brown cereal and I attempted to deliberately smear this on him so that he would have to alter his plans slightly. He was wearing a suit and I did manage to get quite a bit of this brown cereal all over the bottom of his right sleeve. He was annoyed over this, but then he and the girl started into this large room. As they got down to the end of this room, it seemed that Doris was there and she was saying something about coming into the room or being time to come into the room. This seemed to take place just before Calvin came thru the door or perhaps even before he had come thru the door. The momentary fleeting impression might have been to do with it being time for him to come thru the door. Time would have seemed like 11 or 12 minutes as the news broadcast took a while to unfold. In terms of the news broadcast element, I appeared to be an observer throughout all of it except for the terminal part when I was a participant in terms of being in the audience. During the chase scene it seemed as if I were participating in a fragment I can't recall. Then I was an onlooker as the car went by its one destination or stop point and could see the car going by and see the people looking out the glass doors of the station where they were supposed to have gotten off. Then I appeared to be a participant as it seemed as if I were in this car looking out to the auditorium where the people were picking their teeth, but then it seemed as f I were both participant and onlooker in the latter part. I could see myself being in this hallway when they had emerged from the car.","character":"1MOA, 1FSA, 2JSA, 1MKA, 1FSA, 2JSA, 1FKA","emotion":"AN 1MKA","text_len":4980,"word_count":935},{"id":"kenneth","name":"Kenneth","number":"0913","time":"1996-1998","date":"07\/01\/1997","gender":"M","age":"Y","text":"<i>Blond Beard<\/i> <br\/><br\/> People make fun of a man with blond hair and a blond beard.

I am attempting to do a graphics thing on a portable computer I borrowed from some woman. I can't get it to sit up right and she shows me. Dwight is in charge of taking care of Dr. A's cat. Dwight says, \"Let's go to a movie.\" I say, \"OK.\" Dr. A then comes in and suggests we go to a movie with him. He asks if Jake is responsible enough. I say, \"Well, he is 20 years old.\" I then pause and remember, no, he's 40 years old. Dr. A is laying on the ground, sort of in a gutter- like thing in the room. He goes over to talk to Dwight. Dwight tells me that the cat he'd been taking care of died. I look out the window and see a tiger striped cat and say, \"No, he's right out there in the garden.\" Dwight says, \"That's a different cat.\" The cat turns and looks at me and I see the face is different. I give up working on the graphics thing, because I can't get the screen part to stand up at the right angle. I place a ruler under it to hold the angle, but it doesn't work. We go out with Dr. A. I whisper to Dwight, \"Is it OK?\" (meaning not to go to the movie he requested, but go to Dr. A's movie) He says, \"It's OK.\" We go down the hall. I see a sign that says, \"Negative Hypnotists\" or something like that. I think this means this is where patients are taken when the prognosis is negative, to see how they will cope. We go in and I immediately realize this is a psychological testing area (not paper and pencil test, but experimental). The room is huge, long and narrow. A long, long table runs the length of the center of the room. I look around and see Dr. A has chosen a chair in the corner, facing the wall, with his back to us. I say, \"Do you have to sit in the corner?\" (a joke). He doesn't respond and I know that is because he must be a neutral observer and not influence me. I look around and see three or four tiny kindergarten chairs and the examiner seated in one of them. I choose my chair, across the table from him and Dwight sits on my right. Lots of people then enter the room, crazy or depressed or strange people. They wander around the room. I watch. Then a large, muscular, fat woman with short hair comes over really close to me and leans into me. I turn and say to her, \"Get back from me.\" She is belligerent and leans even further into me and says, \"Does this bother you?\" I say, \"Yes, it bothers me.\" I shove her away. She comes back. I say, \"Barb, move back.\" I shove her again. She's hard to move, but I am strong and surer of myself. She repeats this a number of times and finally I manage to push her to the floor and she gets up and leaves. Now everyone leaves. I am alone in this huge room and the doors and windows are shut and bars slam down so it's very obvious I'm being locked in all alone. I feel confident. I know this is a test. I'm not concerned. I even smile a bit at the dramatic flair they do this with. I go to one window where the bars are coming down. They are wooden slats with pointed ends. These ones malfunction and kind of fall softly down and don't completely lock me in. I smirk. Then I walk the length of the room just looking around. As I approach two doors, I see they are partially open and then across the room a white wooden door is slammed shut like someone has just run through and left. I know it is unlocked and they expect me to be desperate and try the door to connect with someone, but I don't feel desperate or curious. I 'd rather explore the two open doors. I go to the first one and push it all the way open. The title of this room is \"Fighting Woman\" room. I go in and see feminist books and hear a recording of feminist books. It's a nice enough room. I go out. I've heard all this before and I go to the next room, the support room. It's a support group therapy room. A body is laying on the couch, covered by a blanket. He starts moving like he's waking up. I see another body on the floor, perpendicular to the couch, her head between the couch and the wall. She was sleeping and is waking up. I step over her to the door. I don't want to stay here and deal with them. It's boring. I am back out in the big room and see the door marked \"employment\" and feel some regret that it is locked, but I'm still in that secure, confident place, knowing this is just a test.","character":"1MKA, 1FSA, 1ANI, 2IOA, 1ANI","emotion":null,"text_len":4308,"word_count":866},{"id":"dorothea","name":"Dorothea: 53 years of dreams","number":"870","time":"1912-1965","date":"12\/17\/64","gender":"F","age":"A","text":"Arranging stamps.

There was a man below me in the water and he was throwing things up into the air and I was catching them and putting them into a compartment above and behind me. I was particularly interested in this man until I caught one thing in particular. When I caught this rocket-looking, blue and white item I thought it was a sign that we were meant to be together. However, when he realized that I had caught it, he instructed me to give it to his mother, that it was intended for her. Later something similar happened, I believe I was below and he was above and caught a bead necklace that I had thrown, and he then realized that we were meant to be together. Our places reversed again and I was catching nearly every necklace he threw upwards. Later we were on a beach. We were in training for something. We had to pass our training to be able to do whatever it is we were applying for. Something happened that we realized that we needed to hide from a group of people. There were very large orange flowers all over the beach. At will, accepted members of our group had the ability to turn them into beach umbrellas for camouflage. They did so until the danger had passed and then they turned the umbrellas back into flowers. I thought this was very cool because I realized that I would soon be able to do that- when I completed my training. Because of my connection to this man I had no doubt that I would be accepted. We ended up getting married.","character":"2JSA, 1MSA, 1FKA, 2JSA","emotion":"AP D, HA D","text_len":1959,"word_count":370},{"id":"madeline4-postgrad","name":"Madeline 4: After College","number":"0831","time":"2003-2004","date":"2004-01-02 (Post-Grad)","gender":"F","age":"Y","text":"My boyfriend Jeremy and I were in the truck in a large field.  It was sort of a scavenger hunt game- to find and correctly identify every cow in the field- there were about 20, and they were mostly black, so defining one from another would be difficult.  We identified one or two and came to one on a hillside that was being difficult.  Somehow to help in the identification, I started tickling it.  We ended up sliding down the hillside together, the cow on its back laughing hysterically.  I thought how few cows get to experience that- even being on its back much less laughing and having fun.  Jeremy and I ended up back in my parents' house somehow, and there was a horse.  Surprisingly I managed to mount the bucking bronco.  I'm not sure why- just to see if I could, I guess.  I rode for a few minutes and slid off, and in its struggle, the horse ended up on top of the stereo cabinet.  I was worried about the glass doors.  One got nicked or scuffed, but nothing broke and the horse finally got down.  Then we ended up somewhere else, near a house with an RV parked in front of it.  I was watching from 3rd person perspective again.  Jeremy and I didn't look like ourselves.  Somehow we had become paralyzed and were in wheelchairs.  We talked to the cops in front of the RV.  There was a blue woman with a red spot in her hair- a cherry tomato perhaps.  We told the cops she was responsible for our paralyzation.  Returned to 1st person view.  The cop asked to see some evidence and we showed them the welts on Jeremy's arm- they looked like paintball welts.","character":"1MKA, 2ANI, 1MOA, 1ANI, 1FSA, 2MOA","emotion":"AP D","text_len":1567,"word_count":292},{"id":"b2","name":"Barb Sanders #2","number":"3794","time":"1997-2001","date":"2000-04-18","gender":"F","age":"A","text":"[\"Someone's in my bed.\"] Gaston and I are together.

There was a little girl with blonde hair. You could tell it was real blonde because the light shining on the face, the little tiny hairs on her arms and face were blonde too. She was staring in the mirror and I was staring at her. We did not move. Still like chess men. We were back in the TV couch room. She had gotten accepted to Wisconsin State and met a guy 5 days before. They were getting married. She left and I was laying on the couch with her fianc&#233;e. I was laying on my back and in front of the TV but not watching it. He was laying on his back with his head in my lap. He had a bald head. He rolled his head from side to side on my lap and it felt good. Then the blonde girl came back. She was exasperated. She said, \"What was I thinking? I'm NOT going to Wisconsin and I'm NOT getting married. The guy got up to try and change her mind but she was already gone. I put on a thick cotton gauze yellow dress. Daffodil yellow. It had one inch shoulder straps but I unzipped the dress and let it fall to my waist so when I walked it dragged the ground and the wind would blow and it would fly out like Batman's cape behind me. My kitty liked to walk just inside the wind tunnel of the dress. I was walking down Washington Sq. When I noticed people staring at me and I realized I was half-naked. I went into the first building on the right that looked friendly. Sure enough there were apartment keys in the elevator. I pushed 3 and 8 but I knew I was going to 11. The dial had no numbers just notches. 2 dials. One above the other. There were 12 floors. I stopped at 3 and 8 but I didn't get off until 11. When I got there it was a fancy apartment but in a way it was very plain. The refrigerator door was open. The house was very neat, but inside the freezer was helter skelter. I set out to make some ice. I filled an ice tray and put it in the freezer. I left the freezer door open but the ice made so quick I could not believe it. I took out the ice and set out to make some more. If I closed the freezer and refrigerator door it would make real fast, I bet, but I had to leave. The folks coming back might shoot me if they came back on Sunday afternoon and a stranger was making ice in the refrigerator. I was in a chicken restaurant that was expanding. They had crazy rules--old\/new. They guy in front of me ordered a chicken breast and baked potato. I didn't know what to order so I didn't order anything. A girl and boy were teaching me to dance a dance. The girl was teaching me. The boy was taking pictures. I didn't know which way to go. I was standing in line to go to the bathroom in a school. Then a black male teacher came in with a line of little kids. They all had to go to the bathroom. It was taking way too long. Long. The teacher told the kids to unbutton and unzip their pants and drop them while standing in line so they would get done sooner. The children's eyes told me they were scared but they were scared NOT to do as they're told so they stood in line with their pants down looking scared in their eyes.","character":"2JSA, 1FSC, 1MSA, 1ANI","emotion":"HA D, AN 1FKA","text_len":3085,"word_count":624},{"id":"b2","name":"Barb Sanders #2","number":"3709","time":"1997-2001","date":"2000-02-01","gender":"F","age":"A","text":"[\"Healing foot.\"] Dr. Smythe is busy and I ask her to take a moment and look at my injured left foot.

Aunt J also alive and healthy. Lost weight and looked young and beautiful. Wondered how this would make Mother feel, to be the only one still overweight. Uncle H's house.

There are a lot of people on here that I went to high school with. Tony S and Dorothy S and their girls are on the bus as well. I'm sitting in the very first seat. I think in the bus are bench seats but none of them have backs on them. I was thinking that I would get home faster if I was driving myself. So I was watching for a particular exit because I knew that from this particular exit I would also be comfortable driving myself home. It was starting to get dark outside. Jeff L came up and sat down next to me. It wasn't until then that I even realized that he was on the bus. I was so excited to see him. We both stood up and hugged and kissed each other on the cheek. We sat back down. He was sitting to my left. I was sitting on the right side of the bus right next to a window. He didn't sit right next to me though. There was enough space between us that another person could've sat there. He looked over at me and said, so you and Darren are still together? I nodded my head yes as I said yes, and then bit my lip to keep from crying. He noticed that something was wrong and said, uh oh. I just looked at him with a kind of sideways glance and he knew that we weren't going to stay together. He kind of nodded his head towards the back of the bus and pointed a finger towards the back but not where anyone could see it and said, no one else knows? I shook my head no. And then I said not even Darren. But I am so happy to see Jeff L that I don't want to have this kind of a conversation with him. At least not right now. I noticed on his ring finger that he wasn't wearing his wedding ring. There is a mark on his finger where he used to where it almost as though he was wearing a cheap ring and it tarnished and left a blackish green mark on his finger. I reached over and pointed to his hand and asked him where his wedding ring is. His jacket had been lying next to him on the seat and he picked it up and said it's in here indicating that it was in one of his jacket pockets. I said, well that's great that you and Gail H are still together. Though, even though he and Gail H dated for quite a few years I don't know if that is actually who he ended up marrying. He nodded yes. I think I said and you're still happy together that's really great. I asked him if they had any children but I don't remember if he responded. Something happened to the bus and we are now stopped at what looks like a rest area. We had been driving on the interstate. There are quite a few people standing around the bus including the bus driver. There's quite a bit of traffic going by very close to where everyone is standing. It turns out that the problem is something with one of the headlights. Somebody is telling us that it is going to take quite a while to get this headlight repaired. We can get back on the road until it gets repaired. I think we have to wait for someone to bring us a replacement headlight so they can replace it there before we get back on the road. We have to get it fixed before we can get back on the road because it's already fairly dark out. I was looking out the window again. When I realized where we were, I thought I could get home faster if I just walked. I said this to someone who was in charge of this event. She agreed with me and said that there were a number of other people who were saying the same thing. She said if any of us wanted to do that we wouldn't need to take our luggage with us, they would deliver it to our homes. I had four small, light weight items with me besides my luggage so I was going to carry those with me. I get off the bus and I set my things on the ground. Now it seems that I am with Dorothy S and she is unloading the back of her vehicle. The vehicle is either an SUV or a pickup truck. She is unloading her things and my things. The vehicle is pulled into a garage. But the main garage door is opened. I'm thinking that there is no way that she can walk home with all of the things that she has and I wouldn't be able to help her because she has things that are so big they are almost bigger than I am and they're so heavy I can hardly pick them up anyway. One of the things I can best describe as a very large fabric bundle. It is somewhat square and about three to four feet wide. It's also fairly thick, six or more inches at least. When she picked it up she also picked up a small red cooler at the same time. That was one of my things, one of the four things, that I decided to carry with me. It's empty so it doesn't weigh hardly anything. So I didn't think it would be a problem to carry home. Then the woman who is in charge of this event walks up and I point to the things that I'm going to carry with me and I tell her that I'm going to go ahead and walk home because that's all I have. They are lightweight so it will be no problem for me to carry them with me. I also have a pair of tennis shoes and a pair of socks sitting there with it. I'm sitting someplace else, and I may be having a conversation with someone. The woman had walked away and I am inside some building doing something. It begins to or down rain. I realize that my things are sitting outside and getting wet. At first I don't get up and go after them. But eventually I do because I especially don't want like tennis shoes and socks to get all wet because I want to be able to put them on to walk home. I don't have an umbrella but I'm still thinking about walking home even though it's pouring rain. When I went out to get them I saw that someone, I think it was this other woman, had set them inside the garage so they wouldn't get all wet.","character":"2JKA, 1MKA, 2FKA, 1MKA","emotion":"HA D","text_len":5632,"word_count":1149},{"id":"hall_female","name":"College women, late 1940s","number":"0024","time":"1946-1950","date":"Code 007, Age 20, 02\/23\/48","gender":"F","age":"Y","text":"I was sitting in a room surrounded by many people.

I started to complain that we weren't prepared, and he said he had a bikini for me in his wallet.  I asked him if he had his wallet, as sometimes he forgets it.  He said he did.  I looked around..we did have towels...and I realized I was wearing my swim suit under my clothes so the bikini wouldn't be an issue.  We stopped somewhere- a pet store.  It was dark, probably closed.  There were lots of aquariums around and one tank had an odd-looking fish.  On the tank said something about he had lost his friend.  That clicked with me and I ran out to the car.  I came back and dropped a fish in the tank with him.  There was an older man across the way and I called him to look- to see if that was the fishy friend that had gone missing.  He said yes, but that the type of fish she was, a 'top fish' she needed a bubbler.  So we moved her to another tank over and she was in the top part, separated from the bottom of the aquarium by netting.  I wondered how this would help as the fish were no longer together and was about to ask when the man offered to show me something.  I hesitated as Jeremy was waiting in the minivan but whatever he was going to show me might help me get a job, so I followed.  He took me over and had two red, blocky mechanisms.  We were kneeling by a row of sinks, I think.  The red thing he held had two little pointer\/penlike things, one on either side.  He pointed the right one and beeped it, then the left.  It was like a grocery scanner for taking inventory.  He did this to several of the sinks.  The count was seven- we were somewhat puzzled as it only should have been three at that point.  He handed the scanner to me so I could try.  I tried to get the order right between which scanner I used and which barcode- I wasn't sure if it made a difference.  So I tried it and asked him if I'd done it right.  He and another person who had joined us at some point said \"blackout\".  Not that there had been one, but that that was what should have been reported by the scanner, for some reason.  He said not to worry, this was just practice.

It was in a different time, with different expectations. A more pure time where there is less gray in the world. But it was a tough system. This was the program for the best of the best, and I was new -- uninitiated to the ways and tactics of these people. They trained through simulations; combat games. This was my first test. They had a young, head-strong cadet before all the rest in the hangar, standing on a sort of metal pad. The captain called me up. Said I would be a part of this exercise. He told me in confidence not to worry, that I would be o.k. Though when I saw the scenario, I felt a sinking feeling. I was to defend a shantytown just inland from a shipyard. I had only a few units, all of them beat-up and out of position. The enemy would have a fleet at his disposal, and enough marines to saturate my men 10 times over. How was this fair? The game began, and I wasted no time. I sprinted out of the hangar and looked to my right, out over the harbor. I could see the massive tangle of warships pulled up nearly to the concrete pier. I sprinted away even harbor. Since my units were out of position, I couldn't even contact them. I didn't even know where they were. They'd be mowed over -- they were mowed over -- before I even knew how many I had. I turned right around a length of chain-link, barbed-wire fence. There an intelligence agent briefly approached me. He handed me a riddle. It was something I needed to find. He told me, \"it will be ok.\" I read the puzzle, hidden on a strip inside a plastic egg. It made no sense. I didn't have the time to put it together! They were coming! I decided I really didn't have any other options but to go with it. So I slowed to a jog, and read it again. Ok, maybe. I ran up the main road and turned down a side street in the city of plywood and corrugated steel panels. There was an area set aside, like a secret power facility. I climbed in through a hole in the fence. I pulled a panel, hit a switch, and there appeared this red gelatinous material. I knew I had to take it. But I didn't know what it did. I grabbed it and ran away as fast as I could. Right when the enemy force was about to take the city in record time, they were forced to stop -- the secret operative radioed to me: do you know what the ___ _____ can do? No, but neither did they. Could it be used as a weapon? What was it? I didn't know. All I knew is that the enemy couldn't roll in completely without first getting their hands on it. I had an idea. If I could stay hidden long enough for the scenario time to run out, I would win -- that is when reinforcements would arrive. The problem -- it would be an entire day. Well, I would do it. My strategy wasn't quite running, and it wasn't quite hiding. I would stay in the shadows of a building, and when I would hear an enemy soldier approaching, I would sprint off. They had a steady grid. Unless I slipped past it, they would find me. I was faster than they were. I remember thinking that if I did hide and I was discovered, there would be no escape from those little shanty houses. Several times I found myself caught in the open by some of them, but they couldn't kill me outright. Their orders were to capture me. So when they closed, I sprinted away, right from their grasp. This continued on, and even spilled into the rich, lush, new center city. Though it was off limits -- and I was warned not to get too close or I would be reset.
